        "with calculi more than 5 mm were included. All patients were evaluated either by X-ray KUB or USG KUB for",

        "duodenal ulcer disease (Chaturvedi et al, 1979). Moreover, clinical efficacy of many",

        "Although the abdominal pain related with meal has been discussed quite often in both the",
        "Vedic literature and classical Ayurvedic texts like Caraka Samhita, Susruta Samhita but it",
        "was a veteran Ayurvedic scholar Madhavakara who first identified this clinical condition",
        "as a separate disease entity. He named it ‘Parinama Sula’ indicating its strong food",
        "relationship. Parinama Sula owing to its similar clinical features is fairly correlated with",
        "duodenal ulcer disease (Chaturvedi et al, 1979). Moreover, clinical efficacy of many",
        "Ayurvedic drugs prescribed for Parinama Sula has been proved in duodenal ulcer disease",
        "by various workers (Varma et al, 1977-Amalaki (Emblica officinale); Chaturvedi et al,",
        "1979- Madhuyasthi (Glycyrhiza glabra). Predominant vitiation of Pitta Dosa appears to",

        "Sula (Cakradutta 27: 35-37, 49-33). The present clinical study evaluates its efficacy in",

        "was found a considerable reduction in the consumption of antacids or antispasmodic",
