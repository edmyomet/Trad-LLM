                "Terminalia arjuna, commonly known as arjuna, belongs to the family of Combretaceae. Its bark decoction is being used in the Indian subcontinent for anginal pain, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and dyslipidemia, based on the observations of ancient physicians for centuries. The utility of arjuna in various cardiovascular diseases needs to be studied further. Therefore, the present review is an effort to give a detailed survey of the literature summarizing the experimental and clinical studies pertinent to arjuna in cardiovascular disorders, which were particularly performed during the last decade. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and clinical studies of arjuna were retrieved through the use of PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane databases. Most of the studies, both experimental and clinical, have suggested that the crude drug possesses anti-ischemic, antioxidant, hypolipidemic, and antiatherogenic activities. Its useful phytoconstituents are: Triterpenoids, β-sitosterol, flavonoids, and glycosides. Triterpenoids and flavonoids are considered to be responsible for its beneficial antioxidant cardiovascular properties. The drug has shown promising effect on ischemic cardiomyopathy. So far, no serious side effects have been reported with arjuna therapy. However, its long-term safety still remains to be elucidated. Though it has been found quite useful in angina pectoris, mild hypertension, and dyslipidemia, its exact role in primary/secondary coronary prevention is yet to be explored.Keywords:Antioxidant; Cardiovascular disorders; Coronary prevention; Flavonoids; Terminalia arjuna; Triterpenoids."

                "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral disease that infects the lower airways, causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and fatal pneumonia. The ripple effect of the COVID-19 outbreak has created serious problems in the healthcare systems of many countries and had far-reaching consequences for the global economy. Thus, effective control measures should be implemented for this coronavirus infection in the future. The ongoing episode of the SARS-CoV-2 sickness, COVID-19, in China, and the subsequent irregular spread of contamination to different nations, has alarmed the clinical and academic community primarily due to the deadly nature of this disease. Being a newly identified virus in the viral classification and having the highest mutation rate, rapid therapeutics are not readily available for treating this ailment, leading to the widespread of the disease and causing social issues for affected individuals. Evidence of Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been found in ancient civilizations, such as those of the Hindus, Babylonians, Hebrews, and Arabs. Although TCM and Ayurvedic herbs do not promise to be very effective treatments for this pandemic, they can reduce infectivity and virulence by enhancing immunity and showing effectiveness in rehabilitation after COVID-19 disease. Thus, they could be used as sources of inhibitor molecules for certain phenomena, such as viral replication, attachment to the host, 3CL protease inhibition, 3a ion channel inhibitors, and reverse transcription inhibition. Medicinal plants from TCM and Ayurveda and their biologically active phytoconstituents can effectively modulate the targets and pathways relevant to inflammation and immune responses in human bodies. The present review analyzes the role of certain TCM and Ayurvedic medicinal plants in healing COVID-19 infection. Medicinal plants such asGlycyrrhiza glabra(licorice),Curcuma longa(turmeric), andZingiber officinale(ginger) are regarded as the main antiviral herbs. Their extracts and individual bioactive compounds could be used as potential substances for developing remedies to prevent or cure the coronavirus disease. Generally, antiviral phytochemicals obtained from natural sources are considered potent candidates for fighting COVID-19 infection and rehabilitation after it.Keywords:Ayurveda; COVID-19; TCM; curcumin; gingerol.; glycyrrhizin; immunomodulation; medicinal plants; quercetin; virucidal effect."

                "Introduction:Medicinal plants and herbs are the most important part of the Ayurveda. The term Rasayana in Charaka Samhita confers long life, youthfulness, strong body, freedom from diseases and the plants mentioned in Rsayana possess antiaging property. Aging is the collective term used for the complex detrimental physiological changes that reduce the functional ability of the cell. Oxidative stress, telomeres shortening, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction are the main factors that regulate the aging process. Chronological aging is an irreversible process but the factors causing biological aging can be controlled. Ayurvedic herbs are better for the management of age-related problems. There are several natural bioactive agents present in plants that can delay the aging process in humans. They trigger actions like enhancing gene longevity and telomerase activity, ROS scavenging furthermore regeneration of tissues.Content:The plants mentioned in the Rasayana of Ayurveda have antiaging potential and can be used to solve modern problems related to aging. Some Ayurvedic plants and their antiaging potential has explained in this review. The main causes of aging, medicinal plants and their use as potential antiaging mediator are covered in this study.Summary:The process of aging is still an enigma. It is a complex, irretrievable, dynamic process that involves a number of factors and is subject to a number of environmental and genetic influences. Rasayana aspect has not been much investigated in clinical trials. Aging is considered to result from free radical damage. According to Charaka, Rasayana drugs open the partially or fully blocked channels. Many Rasayanas show free radical scavenging activity and has the potential to mitigate the effects of aging. It gives an overview of the significance of Ayurvedic medicinal plants as a source of inspiration and the use of these plants as remedies for antiaging.Outlook:This study briefly outlooks the causes of aging and how medicinal plants can be used to reverse the aging process. In this study, we discussed the antiaging potential and mechanistic roles of Ayurvedic herbs. These herbs have the properties to slow down the natural process of aging and can successfully manage common age-related problems.Keywords:Ayurveda; Rasayana; anti-aging; antioxidant; inflammation; phytochemical; telomere."

                "With growing antipathy toward conventional prescription drugs due to the fear of adverse events, the general and patient populations have been increasingly using complementary and alternative medications (CAMs) for managing acute and chronic diseases. The general misconception is that natural herbal-based preparations are devoid of toxicity, and hence short- and long-term use remain justified among people as well as the CAM practitioners who prescribe these medicines. In this regard, Ayurvedic herbal medications have become one of the most utilized in the East, specifically the Indian sub-continent, with increasing use in the West. Recent well-performed observational studies have confirmed the hepatotoxic potential of Ayurvedic drugs. Toxicity stems from direct effects or from indirect effects through herbal metabolites, unknown herb-herb and herb-drug interactions, adulteration of Ayurvedic drugs with other prescription medicines, and contamination due to poor manufacturing practices. In this exhaustive review, we present details on their hepatotoxic potential, discuss the mechanisms, clinical presentation, liver histology and patient outcomes of certain commonly used Ayurvedic herbs which will serve as a knowledge bank for physicians caring for liver disease patients, to support early identification and treatment of those who present with CAM-induced liver injury.Keywords:AYUSH system; Ayurveda; Chronic liver disease; Complementary and alternative medicines; Drug induced liver injury; Herb induced liver injury."

                "Background:Vyanga type of Kshudra Roga, characterised by Niruja (painless), Shyava Varna Mandalas (bluish black patches) occurring especially on the face. The clinical features correlate with melasma, which is an acquired chronic hyperpigmentation disorder, usually seen in women of childbearing age. The drugs which constitute the Varnya Gana Lepa bestow the normal Varna (color) by virtue of their qualities and actions.Aim:To determine the efficacy of Varnya Gana Lepa in the management of Vyanga.Materials and methods:The study was a single armed clinical trial in which total 40 patients of Vyanga belonging to the age group of 16-60 years were enrolled. Paste for external application was prepared by mixing the fine powders of 10 drugs (in equal quantity) of Varnya Gana with lukewarm water and advised to apply Lepa twice daily for 15 days on affected part. The different parameters such as skin color, lesion color, texture-dryness/oiliness, luster, number and size of the lesions, darkness, area and homogeneity of lesion, itching, burning sensation, and melasma area severity index (MASI) score were assessed.Results:There was statistically significant improvement in MASI scores, but in overall assessment, 64.5% patients had mild improvement. Clinical improvement was more evident in darkness parameter when compared to other parameters.Conclusion:The study concludes that Varnya Gana Lepa is a safe and effective formulation in the management of Vyanga (melasma).Keywords:Melasma; Varnya; Varnya Gana Lepa; Vyanga."

                "Dementia has been characterized by atypical neurological syndromes and several cognitive deficits, such as extended memory loss, strange behavior, unusual thinking, impaired judgment, impotence, and difficulty with daily living activities. Dementia is not a disease, but it is caused by several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Lewy's bodies. Several drugs and remedies are indicated for alleviating unusual cognitive decline, but no effective pharmacological treatment regimens are available without side effects. Herbal drugs or traditional medicines like Ayurveda have been known for facilitating and corroborating the balance between mind, brain, body, and environment. Ayurvedic therapy comprises 600 herbal formulas, 250 single plant remedies, and natural and holistic health-giving treatments that relieve dementia in patients and increase vitality. Ayurvedic Rasayana herbs [rejuvenating elements] strengthen the brain cells, enhance memory, and decrease stress. The current medicine scenario in the treatment of dementia has prompted the shift in exploring the efficacy of ayurvedic medicine, its safety, and its efficiency. This review presents the literature on several herbal treatments for improving dementia symptomatology and patients' quality of life.Keywords:Ayurveda; ashwagandha; brahmi; dementia; shankhapushpi; turmeric."

The current study aimed to investigate the phytochemical compounds by GC analysis and carried out physical characterization of the pomegranate seed oil and its self-nanoemulsifying system. Then antioxidant, anti-diabetic, and anti-lipase activities were investigated for both.The pomegranate seed oil was extracted, and its self-nanoemulsifying system was then prepared. Phytochemical compounds were analyzed by GC, and physical characterization was established of the pomegranate seed oil and its self-nanoemulsifying system. Then antioxidant, anti-diabetic, and anti-lipase activities were investigated for both.The GC-MS analysis revealed that punicic acid, β-eleosteric acid, catalpic acid, α-eleosteric acid, and oleic acid were the most predominant compounds in pomegranate seed oil. Other active compounds like linoleic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, and α-linolenic acid were detected in trace percentages. The self-nanoemulsifying system was prepared using various concentrations of surfactant (Tween 80), co-surfactant (Span 80), and pomegranate seed oil. The selected formulation had a PDI of 0.229 ± 0.09 and a droplet size of 189.44 ± 2.1 nm. The free radical scavenging activity of pomegranate seed oil, the self-emulsifying system, and Trolox was conducted using DPPH. The oil-self-nanoemulsifying system showed potent antioxidant activity compared to Trolox. Also, pomegranate oil inhibited α-amylase with a weak IC50value of 354.81 ± 2.3 µg/ml. The oil self-nanoemulsifying system showed potent activity compared to acarbose and had a weaker IC50value (616.59 ± 2.1 µg/ml) and a potent IC50value (43.65 ± 1.9 µg/ml) compared to orlistat.Pomegranate seed oil self-nanoemulsifying system could be applied in the future for the preparation of possible oral medications for the prevention and treatment of oxidative stress, diabetes, and obesity due to its high activity against free radical, amylase, and lipase enzymes compared to pomegranate seed oil itself and the references used. This study reveals that self-nanoemulsion systems can enhance oil drug formulations by improving pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, acting as drug reservoirs, and facilitating efficient oil release.Keywords:Punica Granatum; Anti-diabetic; Anti-obesity; Antioxidant; Nanoemulsion; Self-nanoemulsifying system."

                "Ayurvedic medicine utilizes metal-based preparations, known as bhasmas, to treat various health conditions. Yasad bhasma (YB), a zinc-based ayurvedic preparation, shows promise as a potential candidate for developing zinc-based nanomedicines with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. In this study, we synthesized a formulation combining YB and hydroxychloroquine (HC) as a zinc ionophore (YBHC) and investigated its biocompatibility and antiviral effects against buffalo calf coronavirus (BCoV) in Vero cells. Our results demonstrated that the formulation exhibited good conformity and enhanced cell proliferation compared to untreated cells. Additionally, no cytopathic effects were observed in BCoV-infected Vero cells treated with YBHC and YB, while infected control cells exhibited cytopathic effects. YB showed cytoprotection by promoting epithelial tissue turnover. We further explored whether YB/YBHC exerted a lysosomotropic effect to produce antiviral effects on coronavirus-adapted Vero cells, but no cell internalization was observed. In addition to the synergistic antiviral effect of YB and HC, YB may play a vital role in rejuvenating affected tissues.Keywords:Antiviral; Bovine; Corona virus; Hydroxychloroquine; Yasad bhasam; Zinc."

A laboratory animal is commonly employed as a model to investigate nicotine toxicity, drug dependence, reinforcing effects, and the protective effects of samples against nicotine-induced toxicity. The first in-vitro model was developed to prove the protective effect of Babbul (Acacianilotica Linn.) against nicotine poisoning caused by consumption of tobacco products. The HPTLC method for estimating the protective effect against nicotine poisoning was performed by taking the solvent systems dichloromethane, methanol, and liquid ammonia (25 %)(9:1:0.04v/v/v). This in-vitro approach was done by treating the bark of the Acacia nilotica extract with a standard solution of nicotine, which reduced the concentration of nicotine by 39.12 %. The prescribed HPTLC method can be used successfully to assess Acacia nilotica's protective impact against nicotine toxicity caused by intake of nicotine containing tobacco products.Keywords:Acacia nilotica; HPTLC; Herbal medicine; Nicotine; Tobacco."

                "Background:Palmoplantar psoriasis is a type of psoriasis that primarily affects the palms and soles, characterized by erythematous plaques, scaling, and fissuring. These features can significantly impair the quality of life, varying in severity. Skin disorders often result from lifestyle changes, such as consuming an incompatible diet (Viruddha Ahaar Sewan refers to eating foods in a contradictory order or that vitiate the body's Doshas), unhealthy food habits and a sedentary lifestyle. Additionally, genetics, stress, exposure to radiation or UV light, and other environmental influences can contribute to skin problems. This case report describes the clinical presentation, diagnostic challenges, and psychosocial impact of palmoplantar psoriasis in a 12-year-old male with a high recurrence rate, and highlights successful Ayurvedic management.Aim and objectives:This case study aimed to document the Ayurvedic management and outcomes in a chronic inflammatory skin condition.Methods:A 12-year-old male presented to the Ayurvedic hospital with thick scaling, cracks/fissures, severe itching, and severe pain on both soles, along with a two-year history of recurrent plaques. Thorough analysis was conducted using Ayurvedic examinations, including Dashavidha (10-fold) and Ashtavidha (8-fold), to diagnose the root causes. The condition was managed with Ayurvedic Shaman Chikitsa, involving internal medicine (herbal formulations and dietary modifications) and external applications (therapeutic oils, pastes, and other topical treatments) to alleviate symptoms and promote healing.Observation:Assessment through scores based on clinical features and grading, which was 13 at the time of admission, 2 on day 15, and 0 on day 30. (higher the score higher is the severity of disease).Result:Major improvements in scaling, itching, cracks, and pain on the soles were observed after 15 days of treatment. After 15 days, internal medicines were discontinued, but external applications continued until complete relief, around the 25th day. The patient was reassessed on the 30th day, showing complete resolution of all signs and symptoms with no recurrence.Discussion and conclusion:This study demonstrates that Vipadika (plantar psoriasis) in children can be treated using an Ayurvedic approach, which includes Abhyantar Chikitsa (internal medicines) and Bahya Chikitsa (external or local treatments). The detailed descriptions of all the medicines used, their contents, their applications, and the procedures followed are provided in the main text. This information will be beneficial for physicians, aiding them in effectively treating similar cases of psoriasis."

                "The remarkable biodiversity of medicinal plants worldwide highlights their significance in traditional and alternative medicine. Astavarga, a group of eight medicinal herbs from the Himalayan region of India, including Roscoea purpurea (commonly known as Kakoli), is esteemed in Ayurveda for its health-promoting and rejuvenating properties. In this comprehensive study, we aimed to develop and optimise robust UHPLC-MS/QToF (Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry coupled with quadrupole time of flight) and GC-MS/MS (Gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry) methods to identify the phytochemicals in R. purpurea root hydromethanolic extract and essential oil. We also conducted a comparative assessment of supercritical fluid extraction and conventional solvent extraction methods for the first time in R. purpurea root, highlighting their relevance to the medicinal field. Using the UHPLC/MS-QToF method, we identified a total of fifty-six phytometabolites, while sixteen volatile constituents were discerned within the essential oil of R. purpurea by GC-MS/MS method. Among the volatile constituents, β-eudesmol (40.84 %), guaiac acetate (10.55 %), and γ-eudesmol (10.31 %) were emerged as the principal components. Our findings were further compared with the volatile constituents extracted via supercritical fluid extraction and conventional solvent extraction methods. Notably, our research unveiled the presence of a carotenoid metabolite, 15-methyl retinol, for the first time. Furthermore, our fatty acid analysis of the supercritical fluid extract revealed elevated levels of unsaturated fatty acids, particularly oleic and linoleic acids. The methods were validated in terms of system specificity also. The discovery of these well-recognised therapeutically active components in R. purpurea significantly enhances its potential, highlighting its unique profile among medicinal plants in the Himalayan region and its suitability for traditional Ayurveda.Keywords:15-Methyl retinol; GC-MS/MS; Roscoea purpurea; Supercritical Fluid Extraction; UHPLC-MS/QToF; β-Eudesmol."

                "Aphthous ulcers, also known as canker sores, are the most frequently encountered lesions in the oral cavity by clinicians and particularly by dentists. It might affect populations of all age groups, although common in the younger age group. Though multifactorial causes are known to be associated with the occurrence of aphthae, the most common etiologies are stress, inadequate sleep, and improper digestion. They can appear on the oral mucosa, palate, gingiva, labial mucosa, and tongue. They can be very uncomfortable during mastication, speech, and deglutition. Generally, the management relies on identifying the cause and prescribing medications such as the local application of anesthetic, steroid ointments specifically for refractory cases, and multivitamin tablets to relieve the symptoms. Ayurvedic preparations such as Triphala oral rinse can prove to be really effective in relieving pain and burning sensation and also cause the lesions to subside, although, like other allopathy medications, it is not known to reduce the frequency of episodes. In this article, we present a case of a male patient aged 21 years who came with a complaint of ulcers on the right lateral border of the tongue. He was prescribed Triphala oral rinse and Triphala ingestion for 15 days, and on the follow-up visit, the patient reported the complete resolution of ulcers.Keywords:aphthous ulcer; efficacy; management; stress; triphala."

                "Background:Diabetes is a metabolic disorder requiring the administration of insulin or other oral hypoglycemic medicines. Although metformin is a popular prescription for type 2 diabetes, long-term use of chemotherapy-based diabetes medications can be hazardous. As a result, novel plant medicines with a high concentration of bioactive molecules, no harmful side effects, and potent pharmacological effects must be found. Edible Boswellia sacra (B. sacra) Flueck oleo-gum resin is widely utilized to treat many clinical diseases in traditional Arab, Chinese, African, and Ayurvedic medicine.Objective:The goal of this study was to examine the possible therapeutic benefits of several B. sacra oleo-gum resin extracts on rat streptozotocin (STZ)-induced hyperglycemia (Type II).Materials and methods:For 29 days, hyperglycemic rats are given either metformin (the reference drug; 250 mg/kg body weight per day) or several B. sacra extracts (ethanol, methanol, hydrodistilled, ethyl acetate, and acetone extracts) at doses of 200 or 400 mg/kg/day. Blood glucose levels and body weights were measured before the initiation and at 7, 11, 16, 22, and 29 days after oral treatment. Furthermore, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was carried out. At the end of the study, the rats were euthanized, and blood samples were obtained to evaluate cytokines (interleukin (IL-)2 and IL-8), reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and serum insulin levels. The pancreas and liver tissues were rapidly excised, washed, fixed, and kept in a 10% formalin buffer for histological examination.Results:B. sacra's ethanolic extract had the greatest concentration of total pentacyclic triterpenic acid (PTA) (391.52 mg/g) in comparison to the other extracts. The lower dose of B. sacra ethanol extract, 200 mg/kg/day, reduces blood glucose levels more efficiently than the higher dose of 400 mg/kg/day. In a 180-min OGTT, diabetic rats given ethanol extract (200 mg/kg) performed no better than control rats and even outperformed those given the reference medication metformin. Additionally, ethanol extract (200 mg/kg)- or metformin-treated diabetic rats gained weight. This was associated with a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in serum levels of IL-2 and IL-8, a reduction in oxidative stress as evidenced by a significant (p < 0.05) increase in SOD and GSH compared to the untreated diabetic group, and a significant (p < 0.05) increase in serum insulin levels compared to normal plasma rat levels. These discoveries, which were eventually confirmed by histochemical assays, indicated that the ethanol extract of B. sacra greatly enhanced the cellular architecture of pancreatic and liver cells.Conclusion:The present investigation indicates that the ethanol extract of B. sacra oleo-gum resin, which contains a high proportion of acetyl-β-boswellic acid (β-ABA) and acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), possesses antihyperglycemic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant properties for the first time to our knowledge. Additionally, it restores hepatic cells in STZ-induced diabetic rats and protects the pancreas against oxidative damage. Thus, the current study's results give a scientific rationale for the use of B. sacra in the medical management of diabetes and associated complications. More investigation into the metabolic profiles of these extracts must be conducted to establish the precise mechanism of action of the ethanol extract.Keywords:Antioxidants; Boswellia sacra gum resin; Diabetes; Hypoglycemic agents."

                "Background:In recent years, antibiotic resistance has emerged as a global health concern in bacterial infections such as urinary tract infections (UTIs). Uropathogenic Escherichia coli is the most frequent organism responsible for both simple and complex UTIs. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are frequently associated with complicated UTIs. Sri Lanka has significant resources of medicinal plants used to cure UTIs in Ayurvedic and traditional medicine.Methods:Agar well diffusion and broth microdilution methods were used to determine the antibacterial activity of the methanolic extract of ten medicinal plants against P. aeruginosa ATCC27853, S.aureus ATCC25923, E.coli ATCC25922 and their UTI positive strains extracted from positive culture plates. As a preliminary toxicity assay, the Brine Shrimp Lethality Assay (BSLA) was used to determine its cytotoxicity.Results:The methanolic fruits extract of P. emblica demonstrated the highest antibacterial activity against both E. coli ATCC25922 and E. coli UTI-positive strains. B. diffusa roots extract exhibited the highest activity against S. aureus ATCC25923, while T. chebula fruits extract showed the highest activity against the S. aureus UTI-positive strain. T. involucrata roots extract displayed the highest activity against P. aeruginosa ATCC27853, and Z. officinale rhizomes extract showed the highest activity against the P. aeruginosa UTI-positive strain. Moreover, the plant mixture showed the most substantial antibacterial effect against P. aeruginosa ATCC27853. However, the methanolic seed extract of C. melo did not exhibit any antimicrobial effects against the selected organisms. All plant material, including the plant mixture, showed cytotoxicity according to the BSLA.Conclusion:All the methanolic extracts including P. emblica fruits, O. tenuiflorum whole plant, T. chebula fruits, Z. officinale rhizome, T. terrestris roots, T. involucrata roots, A. lanata whole plant. B. diffusa roots and A. falcatus roots showed antimicrobial effects against selected strains except C. melo seed extract. The results of the present study evidently supports the traditional and ayurvedic use of these plants for the treatment of UTIs. This paves the way for another praise for new plant-based therapeutic product development for the treatment of UTIs. However, further toxicity studies are needed for medicinal dose determination.Keywords:Antimicrobial; BSLA; Medicinal plant; UTIs; Uropathogenic."

                "Objectives:Diastolic dysfunction represents an important pathophysiological intermediate between hypertension and heart failure. In the last two decades, the prevalence of heart failure patients having normal or near normal ejection fraction (EF) has increased to around 60 %. It thus poses a great morbidity and mortality risk to the population. In view of present scenario of high prevalence, lack of evidence-based therapy, and limited clinical trials, this study aimed to evaluate how a Unani formulation affects the improvement of the left ventricular diastolic function.Methods:This clinical trial was set up as a randomized, placebo-controlled study involving 35 participants, with 18 individuals in the test group and 17 in the control group. Test group received 3.5 g of a polyherbal Unani formulation in capsule form along with 35 mL of an extract ofBorago officinalisL. (Arq-e-Gaozaban), divided into two doses after meals. Meanwhile, the control group received a placebo in the same manner over an eight-week period. Follow-ups were conducted every 15 days to assess both subjective and objective parameters in all participants.Results:The test formulation shows significant improvement in dyspnea and diastolic function from baseline to the end of trial (p<0.05), slight improvement in palpitations (p>0.05) and highly significant improvement in easy fatigability (p=0.001) as compared to the control.Conclusions:The present study shows the effectiveness of the test drug in enhancing the diastolic function of left ventricle and alleviating other symptoms associated with ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Nevertheless, additional research with longer follow-up durations is necessary to clarify its efficacy and establish optimal treatment approaches for ventricular diastolic dysfunction in Unani medicine.Keywords:Arq-e-Gaozaban; Zoaf-e-Qalb; Unani medicine; herbal formulation; left ventricular diastolic dysfunction."

                "Background:Medications, including chemotherapeutic drugs, contribute to male infertility as external factors by inducing oxidative stress in testicular cells. Shilajit is a naturally occurring bioactive antioxidant used in Ayurvedic medicine to treat a variety of ailments.Objective:This study examines the potential of Shilajit to counteract the negative effects of the chemotherapeutic drug cyclophosphamide (CPA) on testicular germ cell dynamics.Material and methods:Male Parkes mice received single intraperitoneal CPA injection (200 mg/kg BW) on day one, followed by daily supplementation of Shilajit (100 and 200 mg/kg BW) for one spermatogenic cycle.Results:CPA adversely affected testicular germ cell dynamics by inhibiting the conversion of spermatogonia-to-spermatids, altering testicular histoarchitecture, impairing Sertoli cell function and testicular steroidogenesis, and disturbing the testicular oxido-apoptotic balance. Shilajit supplementation restores testicular germ cell dynamics in CPA-exposed mice, as evidenced by improved histoarchitecture of the testis. Shilajit improves testicular daily production and sperm quality by promoting the conversion of spermatogonia (2C) into spermatids (1C), stimulating germ cell proliferation (PCNA), improving Sertoli cell function (N-Cadherin and β-Catenin), and maintaining the Bax/Bcl2 ratio. Additionally, Shilajit enhances testosterone biosynthesis by activating enzymes like 3β-HSD, and 17β-HSD. Shilajit also reduces testicular oxidative stress by increasing antioxidant enzyme activity (SOD) and decreasing lipid peroxidation (LPO). These effects are mediated by upregulation of the antioxidant protein Nrf-2 and downregulation of Keap-1.Conclusion:The findings underscore the potent androgenic and antioxidant characteristics of Shilajit, as well as its ability to enhance fertility in cases of testicular damage caused by chemotherapeutic drugs.Keywords:Cyclophosphamide; Oxidative stress; Sertoli cell function; Shilajit; Steroidogenesis; Testicular germ cell dynamics."

                "Introduction:Low back and neck pain are common musculoskeletal disorders with multiple treatment options. India's traditional medical systems, known as Ayush (Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa-Rigpa and Homoeopathy) offer range of interventions and are widely used. In view of limited documentation of adverse events following Ayush interventions for lumbar and cervical spondylosis, we synthesized evidence and estimated proportion of studies reporting adverse events.Methods:We systematically searched all published documents from biomedical and multidisciplinary abstract and citation databases and Ayush-specific repositories from their inception to April 2021. We selected studies as per inclusion criteria and extracted information, adhering to PRISMA guidelines. We systematically reviewed the qualitative evidence form the selected studies.Results:Majority (94%) of the selected 113 studies were interventional studies and included 77 (68.1%) journal articles and 35 (31%) academic dissertations. Among the Ayush systems, considerable proportion was from Ayurveda (32.7%), followed by Siddha (24.8%), Yoga (22.1%), Unani (15.9%) and Homoeopathy (4.4%). Almost three-fourths of the studies were on lumbar spondylosis (65%; n = 74), followed by cervical spondylosis (31%; n = 35), and the remaining four included both. Thirteen percent of the 113 studies described adverse events [Yoga = 9.7%; Unani = 1.8% and Homoeopathy = 1.8%]. More adverse events were reported among the studies on lumbar (9.7%) than cervical spondylosis (2.7%). The nature of interventions were non-pharmacological (10.6%; n = 12), pharmacological (n = 2; 1.8%) or combined (n = 1; 0.9%).Conclusions:Only one in eight studies reported any adverse event following Ayush interventions for cervical and lumbar spondylosis. There could be certain degree of underreporting of adverse events and requires further exploration.

                "Introduction:The formidable survival mechanisms employed byMycobacterium tuberculosis(Mtb), combined with the low bioavailability of anti-tubercular drugs and their associated hepatotoxicity, worsen tuberculosis management. Traditional medicinal plants offer potential solutions to these challenges. This study focuses on exploring the anti-tubercular potential ofSolanum virginianumagainstMycobacterium smegmatis,mc2155.Methods and results:HPTLC and UHPLC phytochemically characterized the hydro-methanolic extract ofSolanum virginianum(SVE). SVE curtails the growth and viability ofmc2155under normal andin vitrostress conditions. The compromised cell wall integrity ofmc2155with SVE is depicted through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) while EtBr permeability assays and TLC-based comparative changes in lipids extraction addressed the integrity of the cell wall. Furthermore, SVE augmented the susceptibility ofmc2155towards Isoniazid (INH) through enhanced bioavailability. Adjunct treatment of SVE with INH demonstrated a markedly reduced survival of the intracellular bacilli. The study also uncovered the hepatoprotective potential of SVE in HepG2 cells.Conclusion:This research paves the way for deeper exploration into the potential ofSolanum virginianumagainst virulentMtbstrains, emphasizing over the significance of traditional medicinal plants in tuberculosis treatment. Collectively, the findings suggest SVE as a potent candidate for independent or adjunct anti-tubercular therapy.Keywords:adjunct therapy; isoniazid; mc2155; stress tolerance; targeted metabolomics; tuberculosis."

                "A large number of people annually lose their lives to tuberculosis (TB), which is an age-old disease caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The global spread of TB is a concern for all regions. The south-east Asian region recorded 46% of all new TB cases in 2021, followed by the African and western Pacific regions with 23% and 18%, respectively. Researchers are always searching at natural substances for potential alternative therapeutics to tackle the worrisome growth in multi-drug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis due to the high costs associated with developing new treatments and unfavourable side effects of currently used synthetic pharmaceuticals. Phytochemicals show promising results as a future health aid due to their multi-targeting ability on pathogen cells. In the search for new drug leads, the Ayurvedic and Siddha medical systems have made an extensive use of ethnomedicinal tools, including the use of plants like Amalaki (Emblica officinalis Gaertn.), Guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia willd.), Sariva (Hemidesmus indicus R.Br.), Kustha (Saussurea lappa Falc.), turmeric (Curcuma longa Mal.) and Green tea (Camellia sinensis Linn.). These sources are high in flavonoids, polyphenols, tannins and catechins, has been shown to reduce the risk of TB. In this overview, we look at how natural sources like plants, algae and mushrooms have helped researchers to find new drug leads, and how to back these natural sources through mapping the molecular approaches and other approaches has helped them to defeat MDR.Keywords:Ayurveda; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Nanoparticles; Natural resources; Tuberculosis."

                "Tuberculosis (TB) continues to intimidate the human race since time immemorial not only due to its effects as a medical malady, but also by its impact as a social and economic tragedy. At the dawn of the new millennium, we are still mute witnesses to the silent yet efficient march of this sagacious disease, its myriad manifestations and above all its unequalled, vicious power. Through the millennia, TB never ever disappeared from the developing world. In 1991, the World Health Assembly (WHA) resolution recognized TB as a major global public health problem. The DOTS strategy was launched in 1994, and became the global recommended strategy for TB control since then. The present study deals with clinical evaluation of Rasayana drugs considering of Amalaki (Emblica officinalis Gaertn.), Guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia willd.), Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera L.) Dunal, Yastimadhu (Glycyrrhiza glabra Linn.), Pippali (Piper longum Linn.), Sariva (Hemidesmus indicus R.Br.), Kustha (Saussurea lappa Falc.), Haridra (Curcuma longa Linn.) and Kulinjan (Alpinia galangal Linn.) as an adjuvant therapy with anti-Koch's treatment. The results obtained revealed that Rasayana compound was found to decrease cough (83%), fever (93%), dyspnea (71.3%), hemoptysis (87%) and increase body weight (7.7%) with statistically highly significant (P<0.001).Keywords:Anti-Koch's treatment; DOTS; Rasayana; tuberculosis."

                "Excellent memory, extraordinary intelligence, great academic achievement, and successful career are the dreams of every individual in this era of competition and professionalism. A good memory power acts as a catalyst in all walks of life, be it academic success or maintenance of personal relationships. It is observed that an average man uses only 10% of his natural memory. Remaining 90% is left unused in a haphazard manner. As per the American psychologist Carl Emil Seashore, if one is alert and makes systematic attempts to awaken and use the natural memory properly, his/her natural memory would be activated creatively and would offer benefits of higher order. A comparative study was conducted comprising 90 subjects to know the efficacy of Medhya Rasayana and Yogic practices in short-term memory of school-going children. The study was conducted over a period of 3 months. It was an open, prospective, and randomized clinical study. The subjects of group A formed the control group and they were observed silently for 3 months without any intervention. The subjects in group B were administered with Choorna (powder) of four Medhya Rasayanas, Mandukaparni (Centella asiatica Linn.), Yashtimadhu (Glycyrrhiza glabra Linn.), Guduchi [Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Miers ex Hook. f. and Thoms.], and Sankhapushpi (Convolvulus pluricaulis Choisy), at a dose of 2 g twice daily with milk. Subjects belonging to group C were advocated regular Yogic practices of Asanas, Pranayama, and Dhyana. Further study revealed that among the three groups, group B treated with Medhya Rasayana showed highly significant and most effective changes with respect to objective parameters in the tests, i.e. (1) short-term memory test pictures and (2) serial recall effects test using memory scope. Among the three groups, group C treated with Yogic practices showed highly significant and most effective changes with respect to subjective and objective parameters in mini mental status scale i.e. test 3. The treatment is cost effective and devoid of side effects, which can be beneficial for the community. Mean increase after first follow-up in group B was higher as compared to group C. This shows that Medhya Rasayanas are quick in action and bring about improvement in memory faster when compared with Yogic practices. So, on the whole, group B can be considered to be the most efficient among the three groups.Keywords:Medhya Rasayana; Yogic practices; school children; short term memory."

                "All skin diseases can be included under the umbrella of Kushta Roga. Ekkakushta is a variety of Kshudra Kushtha with dominancy of Vata and Kapha Doshas. It is characterized by symptoms like- Aswedanam, Mahavastum, Matsyashakalopamam, etc., these characteristic features has a striking similarity with Psoriasis. It is a papulosqaumous disorder of the skin, characterized by sharply defined erythmatosqaumous lesion. Due to its chronic and recurrent nature, it has a great impact on the quality of life of the patients. The present study was aimed to compare the effect of Navayasa Rasayana Leha and Medhya Rasayana tablet along with Dhatryadhyo Lepa in patients of Ekkakushta (psoriasis). For this study, the selected patients were randomly divided into two groups. Koshtha Shuddhi was done by Eranda Bruhstha Haritaki (6 g-at night with Ushnodaka) in patients of both the groups for 3 days before starting the treatment. Total 111 patients were selected for present study. Patients of group A (45 patients) were given \"Navayasa Rasayana Leha\" and \"Dhatryadhyo Lepa\" for external application. Stress is a very well known precipitating factor of Psoriasis. Hence, to study the efficacy of Medhya Rasayana drugs, patients of group B (49 patients) were given Medhya Rasayana tablet along with the external application of Dhatryadhyo Lepa. The duration of the study was 3 months with follow up for one month. Both the groups showed highly significant results in all signs, symptoms and other parameters. Navayasa Rasayana Leha and Medhya Rasayana tablet along with Dhatryadhyo Lepa can be used effectively for the treatment of Ekkakushta.Keywords:Dhatryadhyo Lepa; Ekkakushta; Medhya Rasayana tablet; Navayasa Rasayana Leha; Psoriasis."

                "Psoriasis is a chronic disease that can have substantial psychological and social impact on patient's life. Psoriasis has been shown to affect health-related Quality of Life to an extent similar to the effects of other chronic diseases such as depression, myocardial infarction, hypertension, etc. The modern treatment options not only provide temporary relief but also have serious side effects. Thus, the chronic and recurring nature of the disease hampers the Quality of Life to a great extent. In the present study, patients were randomly divided into two groups. Koshtha Shuddhi was done by Eranda bhrushta haritaki (6 g at night with ushnodaka) in patients of both the groups for 3 days before starting the treatment.

Hence, to study the efficacy of Medhya rasayana drugs, patients of group B (49) were given Medhya rasayana tablet along with the application of Dhatryadhyo lepa. The duration of the study was 3 months and follow-up was done for one month. Both the groups showed equally good results on improving the quality of life in the patients in terms of Dermatology life quality index and Psoriasis disability index.Keywords:Dhatryadhyo lepa; Medhya Rasayana; Navayasa Rasayana leha; Psoriasis."

                "Several methods of limb bandaging have been described to reduce the oedema and enhance ulcer healing in complicated varicose veins, with varying success rates. Leech therapy has never before been tried for the same. We evaluated the effectiveness of medicinal leech therapy in producing venous decongestion, reversal of oedema, hyperpigmentation and healing of varicose ulcer(s). Whether the leech selectively sucks venous blood was also investigated. Hirudo medicinalis (medicinal leech) was applied to the area surrounding the varicose ulcer(s) in 20 patients with varicose veins with complications and the patients monitored for ulcer healing, and decrease in hyperpigmentation, oedema and limb girth. The partial pressure of O2 (pO2) of 7 patients' arterial and venous blood was compared to that sucked by the leech. After leech therapy all the ulcers showed healing, while 95 per cent of patients showed a decrease in oedema and limb girth. Seventy five per cent patients demonstrated a decrease in hyperpigmentation. The mean pO2 of blood sucked by the leech was 40.05 +/- 7.24 mmHg, which was similar to the mean pO2 of the patients' venous blood (34.33 +/- 8.4 mmHg). Thus it appears from this study that the medicinal leech sucks venous blood and aids ulcer healing, and can probably therefore be used as an effective adjunct in the management of complicated varicose veins. This however requires further evaluation by controlled trials."

We present a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating treatment with herbal medicines in active ulcerative colitis (UC). A search query designed by a library informationist was used to identify potential articles for inclusion. Articles were screened and data were extracted by at least two investigators. Outcomes of interest included clinical response, clinical remission, endoscopic response, endoscopic remission, and safety. We identified 28 RCTs for 18 herbs. In pooled analyses, when compared with placebo, clinical response rates were significantly higher forIndigo naturalis(IN) (RR 3.70, 95% CI 1.97–6.95), but not forCurcuma longa(CL) (RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.99–2.58) orAndrographis paniculata(AP) (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.71–1.26). There was a significantly higher rate of clinical remission for CL (RR 2.58, 95% CI 1.18–5.63), but not for AP (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.86–2.01). Higher rates of endoscopic response (RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.08–2.26) and remission (RR 19.37, 95% CI 2.71–138.42) were significant for CL.

            "Introduction": [
                "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an immune-mediated chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) characterized by relapsing and remitting mucosal inflammation in the colon [1,2,3]. The worldwide prevalence of UC is on the rise and patients often experience debilitating symptoms including diarrhea, abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, extra-intestinal manifestations, and an increased risk of colorectal cancer [1,2,4]. The complex pathophysiology of UC has been attributed to a combination of genetic and environmental factors that result in immune system dysregulation, including impaired mucin synthesis, increased activation of inflammatory cytokines, regulatory and effector T cell imbalance, and gut microbial dysbiosis [1,5]. Current treatment strategies target inflammation including aminosalicylates, immunosuppressants, and biologics with the goal of improving clinical symptoms and inducing remission [2,5]. Despite these therapies, around 15% of patients will continue to struggle with relapsing disease and will eventually require partial or total colectomies [4]. Immunosuppressant medications also carry the risk of serious adverse events, including malignancies, such as lymphoma, and infections, such as the reactivation of tuberculosis [3]. There continues to be an unmet need for effective and tolerable therapies.Due to a perceived lack of response to standard therapy, concerns about the side effects of conventional therapies, and a feeling of control over their disease many patients with IBD turn towards complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) more so than the general population [3,5,6,7,8,9]. Herbal medicines are the most used CAM approach with 19–54% of patients with IBD reporting their use [7,10,11,12]. However, many patients do not disclose herbal medicine use with their providers and many providers lack the knowledge and access to high quality clinical data to be able to guide their patients with regard to CAM use [6,7,8,13].Although there have been narrative and systematic reviews of dietary supplements and herbal medicines for IBD [14,15,16,17,18,19], many of these reviews have focused only on the most commonly used supplements, included observational studies, and included patients with both active disease and remission. The aim of this study was to perform a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of herbal medicines used in the treatment of active UC."

                "Herbal medicines are being used with increasing frequency by patients with UC, due to continued relapsing disease despite treatment, the perception that herbal remedies are less toxic than current standards of care, and the increasing availability of herbal supplements. Despite this, healthcare providers often have limited knowledge or skills in guiding their patients regarding the safety and efficacy of herbal products. This systematic review compiles data and provides a comprehensive resource of RCTs for herbal medicines used in the treatment of active UC to inform future research directions, treatment guidelines, and help healthcare providers guide patients in their use.There were 28 RCTs investigating 18 different herbs for the treatment of active UC identified in our literature search.Curcuma longa, otherwise known as curcumin, was the most studied and can be recommended as an added therapy to induce clinical remission in UC. Our meta-analysis revealed improved rates of clinical remission, endoscopic response, and endoscopic remission when compared to control, but we did not find a significant difference in clinical response rates. This may be due to the inclusion of studies by Kumar et al. [22], which had a higher risk of bias and lower quality compared to other studies due to only an abstract being available, and Kedia et al. [21], which had a high attrition rate and lower dose, in the meta-analysis for clinical response. Pooled data should be interpreted with caution given that the sample size despite pooling studies remained <300, there was moderate heterogeneity among studies evaluated for clinical response and remission, and the overall quality of the evidence was very low. However, there are notably promising preclinical and clinical results that should encourage further investigation with higher quality and larger scale RCTs using consistent and accessible formulations and doses. Given its favorable safety profile, curcumin can likely be recommended as an adjunctive treatment in addition to the standard of care for inducing remission in active UC.Indigo naturalishas potential benefits and is used extensively in TCM. The pooled sample size from two RCTs in our meta-analysis was small (n= 81) and the quality of evidence was very low. However, we found a significantly improved rate of clinical response in the treatment group compared to placebo. In addition, there have been small observational and uncontrolled open-label studies that have supported the efficacy of IN [67,68,69,70]. However, adverse events associated with IN have been reported with case reports of pulmonary arterial hypertension, intussusception, and ischemic colitis [108,109,110,111]. A Japanese nationwide survey of 877 UC patients using IN reported liver dysfunction (n= 40), gastrointestinal symptoms (n= 21), headache (n= 13), and PAH (n= 11), although liver dysfunction and PAH were reversible after discontinuation of IN and no IN-associated deaths were reported [28]. Until higher quality and larger scale studies can verify the safety of IN, we recommend that its use should be approached with caution.We did not find a statistical difference in rates of clinical response, clinical remission, or endoscopic response between patients treated with 1200 mg daily of oral HMPL-004 (A. paniculata) or placebo in a pooled analysis of 257 subjects. However, the RCT by Sandborn et al. [30] found that a higher dose of 1800 mg daily of oral HMPL-004 had a significantly higher rate of clinical response when compared to placebo (p= 0.018), with no dose-dependent toxicity [30]. Although the recommended dose ofA. paniculataextract in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia is listed as 0.63–1.26 g/day, this suggests that further research with higher doses ofA. paniculatamay yield more promising results. With regard to safety, the incidence of adverse events was similar among treatment and control groups although a reversible mild rash was reported in 8% of patients receivingA. paniculatavs. 1% in the control group in the RCT by Sandborn et al. [30,31].The single RCTs identified forBoswellia serrata, green tea, andPunica granatumrevealed a statistically significant improvement in clinical response and/or clinical remission and would benefit from further investigation. Improvement in disease activity scores observed with treatment with saffron,Thymus kotschyanus, or wheatgrass suggests that they could potentially elicit a clinical response. Studies ofPlantago major, olive oil, and wheatgrass reported improvement in symptoms of UC, such as abdominal pain or blood in stools. The use ofArthrospira platensis, flaxseed, licorice, andPistacia lentiscuswas found to improve quality of life in patients with active UC. Some RCTs also reported improvement in inflammatory markers, such as hs-CRP, ESR, IL-6, and TNFα, when treated with licorice, flaxseed, saffron, orThymus kotschyanus. Many of the studies were conducted on patients taking 5-ASAs or other conventional UC treatments, suggesting a potential role for herbal medicines as an added therapy to improve clinical response and clinical remission rates in UC that warrants further investigation with larger scale RCTs.Despite these promising findings, the quality of evidence was determined to be very low for most herbs due to the small number of RCTs available and small sample sizes. Four of the studies included were only available as abstracts, which limited available information to assess the quality of evidence. The included studies had variable risk of bias (Table 2). Many of the studies excluded patients with medical comorbidities, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. The majority of studies have looked at herbal medicines as an added therapy to conventional treatment, which limits their potential use to this setting. The herbal medicines discussed here are not covered by insurance and their associated costs can be a barrier to their use.With regard to safety, few serious adverse events were reported and the incidence of adverse events was comparable between treatment and control groups in the majority of RCTs discussed. However, larger scale studies are needed to verify safety. Many herbal constituents have been noted to interact with CYP450 enzymes in vitro and may result in theoretical herb–drug interactions [112], although further in vivo studies are needed. In addition, the FDA classifies herbal medicines as food supplements and they are, therefore, not subject to the FDA’s rigorous drug approval process imposed on pharmaceutical drugs [112]. Although the FDA has implemented rules for Good Manufacturing Practices, there is limited enforcement and significant variability in manufacturing practices, resulting in a lack of biological and pharmaceutical equivalence between products. This limits the reliability of over-the-counter herbal supplements and many of the specific formulations used in the discussed studies are not commercially available in the United States."

                "This systematic review was conducted using PRISMA guidelines (PRISMA checklist available inSupplementary Materials) but was not registered. Candidate studies for inclusion into this review were identified through systematic literature searches from inception to September 2022 in the following electronic databases: Medline (PubMed), EMBASE (Embase.com), the Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Methodology Register, and Web of Science (Figure 1). The search strategy was developed and executed by a library informationist. Keywords and appropriate controlled vocabulary terms, including the following Emtree terms: “ulcerative colitis”, “medicinal plant”, “plant extract”, “plant medicinal product”, and “randomized controlled trial” were used to develop the search strategies for all databases. Studies were considered eligible if they met the following criteria: (1) human patients with active mild, moderate, or severe UC at the time of enrollment, as defined by the study; (2) prospective controlled studies controlled either with placebo or conventional treatment; and (3) intervention included an herbal medicine. Studies were excluded for the following criteria: (1) they were performed in animals, (2) IBD was in remission at baseline, (3) studies were biochemical models, case series, case reports, narrative reviews, or editorials, and (4) the intervention combined multiple herbal ingredients. The primary outcomes were clinical remission and clinical response. Secondary outcomes included endoscopic response, endoscopic remission, and safety.All titles, abstracts, and full-length publications of selected articles were screened for final inclusion by two independent reviewers (Figure 1). A third investigator served to adjudicate any discrepancies at all stages of study selection. Clarification regarding the potential republishing of data between poster abstracts and full-length publications was obtained by contacting the authors as needed. The data variables extracted from articles are presented inTable 1. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to assess the potential risk of bias in each included study. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was used to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome.Studies were grouped by herbal intervention. Meta-analyses with Forest plots were generated with pooled studies that shared similar comparators and outcomes. Risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated while applying random effects models. For each outcome, heterogeneity was qualitatively and quantitatively assessed, the latter using the I2statistic and Χ2test withp< 0.10 considered significant heterogeneity. A two-tailed α threshold of 0.05 was otherwise used to delineate statistical significance. Analyses were conducted using Review Manager 5.4.1 (The Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK)."

Curcuma longaCurcumin is an active polyphenol derived from theCurcuma longarhizome, which is a member of the ginger family [15,20,25]. It has been used for centuries in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Ayurveda and is designated as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) as a food additive for cooking by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [15,20,25]. Several laboratory and murine colitis model studies have established the antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic effects of curcumin [50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57]. The key anti-inflammatory mechanisms include the downregulation of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and other signaling pathways that play a central role in the pathogenesis of UC by increasing pro-inflammatory cytokine transcription and breaking down the intestinal barrier [58]. Curcumin has also been found to enhance intestinal barrier function through the upregulation of tight junction proteins, increased antioxidant enzyme activity, and the alteration of the microbiome with an increase in anti-inflammatory short-chain fatty-acid-producing bacteria [59,60,61].3.1.1. Clinical EvidenceOur literature search identified eight RCTs investigating treatment with curcumin in active UC (Table 1).Four studies investigating oral curcumin supported its use as an added therapy to induce clinical remission in active UC. Lang et al. [15] reported that treatment with 3 g/day of oral curcumin resulted in significantly higher rates of clinical remission, clinical improvement, and endoscopic response compared to placebo in patients with mild to moderate UC taking mesalamine [15]. Similarly, Banerjee et al. [20] reported significantly higher rates of clinical response, clinical remission, and endoscopic remission among patients taking 50 mg/day of bioenhanced curcumin twice daily compared with placebo in patients taking mesalamine [20]. Masoodi et al. [24] studied curcuminoid nanomicelles with mesalamine and reported a reduction in the urgency of defecation score, mean Simple Colitis Clinical Activity Index (SCCAI) score, and patients’ self-reported well-being, although it was unclear how long patients had been taking oral mesalamine if at all prior to study onset [24]. Sadeghi et al. [25] reported higher rates of clinical response and clinical remission, decreased hs-CRP and ESR levels, and improved IBDQ-9 scores in patients taking oral curcumin compared to placebo in patients taking stable doses of UC medications, although a significant difference in education level between groups may have been confounding [25].An enema formulation of curcumin in combination with oral 5-ASA for the treatment of ulcerative proctitis/procotsigmoiditis was investigated by Singla et al. [27]. This trial reported significantly higher rates of clinical response, clinical remission, and mucosal healing for the curcumin group compared to placebo in the per protocol analysis, but not the intention to treat analysis, which was attributed to a small sample size and high dropout rate in both groups [27].Despite these promising results, there have been some studies with contradictory findings. Two abstracts with limited study details published by the same group reported data from studies investigating oral curcumin powder in combination with mesalamine or steroids [22,26]. Kumar et al. [22] reported that the proportion of patients who had a ≥25 point decrease in fecal calprotectin was significantly greater in the treatment group, although the difference in clinical response was not statistically significant when compared to placebo [22]. Shivakumar et al. [26] reported a statistical difference in the mean reduction in fecal calprotectin levels and a better, although not statistically significant, response in histologic activity, stool frequency, stool consistency, rectal bleeding, and Mayo score when compared to placebo [26]. The authors were not able to be contacted to inquire if the reported data in the two studies were from the same trial, but different clinical scales were used and different data were reported, suggesting separate study populations. Given that different outcomes were reported, data from the two abstracts were not pooled together in meta-analyses.Kedia et al. [21] also did not report a significant effect of oral purified curcumin capsules (450 mg/day) in combination with mesalamine on clinical response, clinical remission, or mucosal healing when compared to placebo, which was attributed to a potentially inadequate dose of curcumin [21].Meta-analyses included 321 subjects from 6 RCTs for clinical response, 268 subjects from 5 RCTs for clinical remission, 160 subjects from 4 RCTs for endoscopic response, and 107 subjects from 2 RCTs for endoscopic remission. The rates of clinical remission (RR 2.58, 95% CI 1.18–5.63), endoscopic response (RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.08–2.26), and endoscopic remission (RR 19.37, 95% CI 2.71–138.42) were significantly greater with curcumin compared to control (Figure 2), suggesting efficacy in treating active UC. The difference in the rate of clinical response in the curcumin and control groups was not significant (RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.99–2.58).3.1.2. Adverse EventsSerious adverse events (AEs) were only reported in three RCTs and primarily included subjects who were withdrawn from the study due to worsening UC [20,23,27]. However, the difference in incidence of mild or serious AEs was not statistically significant between treatment and control groups in any of the included studies. Mild adverse events included abdominal bloating, nausea, yellow stool, headaches, heartburn, and dyspepsia, among others.3.1.3. Quality of EvidenceThe certainty of evidence using GRADE was very low (Figure 2). Study limitations included small sample sizes, heterogeneity in dosages and formulations between RCTs, and some RCTs only being published as an abstract with limited information available to assess quality of evidence (Table 2).3.2. Indigo naturalisIndigo naturalis(IN), also known as Qing-Dai, is a dry pigment extract derived from a variety of plants, such asIndigofera tinctoria, and is traditionally used in TCM for inflammatory disorders, including UC [28,62]. The anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and mucosal protection effects of IN have been attributed to the normalization of NFκB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) expression, Th1 and Th2-mediated immune regulation, downregulation of inflammatory cytokine (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α) production, attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) production, and facilitation of intestinal repair [63,64,65,66].3.2.1. Clinical EvidenceNaganuma et al. [28] performed a multicenter study in Japan, in which patients with moderately active UC on conventional therapy were randomized to receive placebo or 0.5 g, 1 g, or 2 g IN daily for 8 weeks [28]. They reported a statistically significant and dose-dependent linear trend in clinical response rates and a significantly greater clinical remission rate in the 1 g and 2 g groups compared to placebo [28]. In another multicenter study, Uchiyama et al. [29] reported a significantly greater clinical response rate in patients with mild to moderate UC treated with 500 mg IN daily compared to placebo [29]. In pooled analysis of the 87 total subjects in these 2 RCTs, the clinical response rate was significantly greater (RR 3.70, 95% CI 1.97–6.95) among patients treated with 500 mg IN compared to placebo (Figure 3) suggesting efficacy in the treatment of active UC.Although our study only identified two RCTs, there have been small observational and uncontrolled open-label studies that have further supported the efficacy of IN. Matsuno et al. [67] treated 33 moderate to severely active UC patients with 2 g of oral IN daily for one year with clinical remission rates of 67% and 73% and mucosal healing rates of 48% and 70% at weeks 4 and 52, respectively [67]. In a retrospective observational study by the same group, clinical response and remission rates at 4 weeks were 94.1% and 88.2%, respectively, in 17 active UC patients treated with 2–3 g/day of oral IN [68]. A pilot study of 20 patients with moderately active UC taking IN 2 g daily for 8 weeks had clinical response, clinical remission, and mucosal healing rates of 72%, 33%, and 61%, respectively [62]. In an open-label study of 11 patients with treatment refractory UC treated with 500 mg/day or 1.5 g/day oral IN, 10 patients achieved clinical response, all patients experienced endoscopic improvement, and 3 patients achieved clinical remission at 8 weeks [69]. A pilot study of 10 patients with active UC who were treated with 50 mg IN suppository for 4 weeks reported clinical remission and mucosal healing rates of 30% and 40%, respectively [70]. These studies, in addition to our meta-analysis findings, suggest that IN has a promising role in the adjuvant treatment of active UC. However, further investigation, particularly pertaining to safety, is required before IN can be recommended.3.2.2. Adverse EventsMinor adverse events reported in the RCTs identified in this study included liver dysfunction, headache, epigastric/abdominal pain, nausea, palpitations, and constipation. However, the trial by Naganuma et al. [28] was terminated early because of an external report of pulmonary hypertension in a patient who used self-purchased IN for 6 months.3.2.3. Quality of EvidenceThe certainty of evidence using GRADE was very low (Figure 3). Study limitations included possible selective reporting, a high attrition rate, and small sample sizes.3.3. Andrographis paniculataAndrographis paniculatais an herb used in Ayurveda and TCM. Its medicinal properties are attributed to andrographolides and other phytochemicals, which are anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial [71]. In active bacterial infections, andrographolides are found to decrease the proinflammatory expression of MAPK and inhibit NO production [71,72]. Andrographolides also inhibit platelet activating factor (PAF)-induced platelet aggregation in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, which can have anti-inflammatory effects [71].3.3.1. Clinical EvidenceSandborn et al. [30] investigated the use of anA. paniculataethanol extract (HMPL-004) at doses of 1200 mg and 1800 mg daily in patients with UC taking mesalamine [30]. They reported significantly greater clinical response rates in the 1800 mg HMPL-004 group, but not the 1200 mg group when compared to the control. Mucosal healing rates were not significantly different between groups [30]. Similarly, Tang et al. [31] reported that clinical response, clinical remission, and endoscopic response rates were not statistically different between patients treated with 1200 mg/day of HMPL-004 compared to mesalazine [31].A meta-analysis compiling data of 257 subjects treated with 1200 mg/day HMPL-004 compared to mesalamine or placebo with mesalamine was conducted. We found no statistically significant differences between groups for clinical response (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.71–1.26), clinical remission (RR 1.31 95% CI 0.86–2.01), or endoscopic response (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.77–1.40) (Figure 4).3.3.2. Adverse EventsBoth RCTs reported mild to moderate adverse events, including abdominal pain, dyspepsia, nausea, and flatulence in both groups. Tang et al. [31] reported that 4% of the treatment group had serious adverse events, including worsening UC, requiring hospitalization, and pregnancy, compared to 0% in the control group [31]. Sandborn et al. [30] reported a similar rate of minor adverse events across all groups, but reported a higher incidence of rash in the intervention groups [30].3.3.3. Quality of EvidenceThe certainty of evidence using GRADE was very low (Figure 4). One potential issue with compiling this data is that the RCT by Tang et al. [31] compares mesalazine to HMPL-004 alone, while patients treated with HMPL-004 in the RCT by Sandborn et al. [30] were permitted to be taking concomitant mesalazine. Sandborn et al. [30] reported a significantly greater clinical response rate in patients taking 1800 mg HMPL-004 with mesalazine compared to mesalazine only, suggesting that higher doses may be more effective [30]. Neither study mentioned limitations, suggesting a high reporting bias. Further research is needed to make definitive conclusions.3.4. Aloe veraThe mucilaginous gel from the leaf pulp ofAloe vera(Aloe barbadensisMiller), a perennial succulent, has been used medicinally in Indian, Chinese, Egyptian, and European cultures to treat gastrointestinal conditions, skin injuries, osteoporosis, and cancer [32,73].Aloe vera’s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties have been attributed primarily to its anthraquinones, including aloe-emodin and its c-glycoside, aloin, which possess peroxyl radical scavenging activity [74].Aloe verais thought to enhance the intestinal barrier function by inducing mucin expression and increasing the thickness of the mucus layer, which can mitigate inflammation and colonic tissue damage [75].3.4.1. Clinical EvidenceLangmead et al. [32] compared oralAloe veragel with placebo in a 2:1 ratio among patients with mild to moderate UC [32]. Although median SCCAI and histologic scores decreased in the treatment group, the rates of clinical improvement, clinical remission, and sigmoidoscopic remission were not statistically significant [32]. Similarly, a small study by Pica et al. [33] revealed a significant decrease in the average disease activity index (DAI) score among 10 patients treated with dailyAloe veragel enemas in combination with oral mesalamine, which was not seen in the placebo group [33].3.4.2. Adverse EventsSerious adverse events were not reported in Langmead et al. [32] and were not discussed in the abstract by Pica et al. [32,33]. However, given the small size of the available studies, definitive conclusions about safety and efficacy cannot be made.3.4.3. Quality of EvidenceThe overall quality of evidence is low given limited data. Limitations of the study by Langmead et al. [32] include having a small sample size, a 20–21% attrition rate, inter-observer variability for sigmoidoscopic scoring, and a variety of baseline concomitant UC medications, although these factors were balanced among groups. Only an abstract was available to evaluate the study by Pica et al. [33], so evaluation of risk of bias was limited and limited outcome data were reported, suggesting a higher risk of reporting bias.3.5. Arthrospira platenesisArthrospira platensis, also known as spirulina, is a blue–green microalgae with antioxidant properties that is a natural source of vitamins (vitamins B12 and provitamin A), minerals, and phytochemicals (carotenoids and phycocyanins) [34]. A murine colitis study showed that treatment with spirulina reduced DSS-induced damage, reduced ROS, increased antioxidant enzyme activity, and modulated gut microbiota [56].3.5.1. Clinical EvidenceMoradi et al. [34] evaluated the effects of spirulina capsules on anthropometric indices, mood, sleep, and quality of life in patients with mild to moderate UC taking conventional therapy [34]. No significant effects were found on anthropometric indices such as body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure. Both treatment and control groups had a significant increase in quality of life and reduction in sleep disturbances and stress scores over the study period, but there was also a significant difference in quality of life and stress scores between groups at the end of the study [34].3.5.2. Quality of EvidenceThis study had a low risk of bias but, overall, the quality of evidence for its use in UC is very low given the limited data.3.6. Boswellia serrataBoswellia serrata, also known as Indian frankincense, is a plant grown in India, Northern Africa, and the Middle East [76]. Although it is widely used as incense in cultural and ceremonial settings, its gum resin extracts have also been used to treat inflammatory diseases. This is due to the anti-inflammatory activity of boswellic acids, such as acetyl-11-keto-ß-boswellic acid, which specifically inhibits a key enzyme in leukotriene synthesis, 5-lipoxygenase [35,76].B. serratahas also been shown to inhibit MAPKs as well as TNF-α and NO production in human peripheral mononuclear cells [76].3.6.1. Clinical EvidenceGupta et al. [35] investigated the use of Sallai gugal (B. serrata) capsules compared to sulfasalazine in eight patients with grade II-III UC in an open non-randomized trial [35]. Both groups had similar rates of clinical remission and experienced an improvement in symptoms, such as abdominal pain and mucus, blood, or necrotic material in the stool. Although outcomes were intentionally not statistically compared between groups, similarity in outcomes may suggest non-inferiority betweenB. serrataand sulfasalazine [35].3.6.2. Adverse EventsIn total, 17.6% of the intervention group reported mild adverse effects, including nausea, abdomen fullness, and epigastric pain, compared with 0% of the control group [35].3.6.3. Quality of EvidenceThe quality of evidence in active UC is very low due to limited data. The study by Gupta et al. [35] was not randomized and had a small sample size, with a disproportionate intervention to control ratio, selective reporting, and unclear study outcomes, resulting in a high risk of bias.B. serratahas been studied in other forms of IBD, such as Crohn’s disease (CD) and collagenous colitis, as well as experimental colitis models with mixed results, suggesting that further investigation is warranted to clarify its potential role in the treatment of UC [77].3.7. Green TeaGreen tea (Camellia sinensis) leaves are rich in polyphenols including catechins, such as epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which are thought to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic effects [36,78,79]. The anti-inflammatory effects of EGCG have been attributed to the inhibition of NF-κB, the downregulation of inflammatory cytokines, and the upregulation of tumor growth factor ß (TGFß) expression [36,79,80,81,82].3.7.1. Clinical EvidenceIn a trial by Dryden et al. [36], participants with mild to moderate UC were randomized in a 4:1 ratio to low dose oral EGCG-rich polyphenol E 200 mg twice daily, high dose polyphenol E 400 mg twice daily, or placebo [36]. Clinical response and clinical remission rates were 66.7% and 53.3%, respectively, in the combined intervention group and 0% in the placebo group.3.7.2. Adverse EventsNo serious adverse events were reported, although one patient in the intervention group required hospitalization forC. difficileinfection [36].3.7.3. Quality of EvidenceGiven the small sample size and inadequate powering of the study by Dryden et al., definitive conclusions cannot be made about the safety or efficacy of polyphenol E in active UC. However, multiple murine colitis model studies have shown promising results that should encourage further large scale RCTs given the accessibility and tolerability of green tea [80].3.8. FlaxseedFlax (Linum usitatissimum) is a plant that is cultivated as a food crop and is thought to be a functional food due to its soluble fiber, α-linolenic acid (ALA), and phytoestrogen content [38]. The oil derived from flax seeds is rich in antioxidants, polyphenols, and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), including ALA, which is a precursor to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). A study of colon mucosa biopsies from UC patients found that inflamed mucosa has higher levels of arachidonic acid and lower levels of ALA and EPA compared to control. Omega-3 PUFAs competitively inhibit the conversion of arachidonic acid to inflammatory eicosanoids (e.g., prostaglandins, leukotrienes) and activate the anti-inflammatory transcription peroxisome proliferator activator receptor (PPAR)-γ [83]. Animal colitis models have also reported that ALA decreases inflammatory cytokine production, NFκB activation, and intestinal permeability [84,85].3.8.1. Clinical EvidenceIn an RCT by Morshedzadeh et al. [37,38], patients with mild to moderate UC taking 5-ASAs were randomized to ground flaxseed (GF), flaxseed oil (FO), or a control group that only received medical advice [37,38]. After 12 weeks, there were significant decreases in fecal calprotectin, Mayo score, ESR (p< 0.001), INF-γ (p< 0.001), IL-6 (p< 0.001), waist circumference (p= 0.02), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (p< 0.001), and systolic blood pressure (SBP) (p< 0.001), as well as a significant increase in TGF-β (p< 0.001) and Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire-9 (IBDQ-9) score in the GF and FO groups compared to control [37]. There was no statistical difference between the FO and GF groups except for a greater increase in TGF-β in the GF group (p= 0.007) [37].3.8.2. Adverse EventsAdverse events were not reported in the articles by Morshedzadeh et al. [37,38].3.8.3. Quality of EvidenceThese findings suggest potential for improving clinical response rates in UC, but further research is needed. The current evidence for the use of flaxseed is very low given the limited number of studies and high risk of bias. Limitations of the study by Morshedzadeh et al. [37,38] were its open-label design and lack of an appropriate placebo in the control group.3.9. LicoriceLicorice is an herbaceous flowering plant that has been used in Chinese, Indian, and Greek medicine for centuries. The active compounds in licorice include triterpinoids, such as glycyrrhizin, and flavonoids, such as glabiridin [86]. Licorice has been found to suppress inflammatory cytokine and ROS production, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), myeloperoxidase (MPO), cyclooxygenase (COX), and NFκB, resulting in anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects [86].3.9.1. Clinical EvidenceSun et al. randomized patients with active UC to treatment with oral mesalazine or a combination of oral licorice decoction with mesalazine [39]. Clinical total effective rate, IL-10 levels, and IBDQ scores were significantly higher (p< 0.05) while interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-17, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels were significantly lower (p< 0.05) in the licorice group compared to control after 6 weeks [39].3.9.2. Adverse EventsNo adverse events were reported in the limited information available in the abstract by Sun et al. [39].3.9.3. Quality of EvidenceOnly an abstract for this published study was available in English, so risk of bias was difficult to adequately ascertain. The quality of evidence for licorice as a treatment of active UC is, therefore, very low.3.10. Olive OilExtra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is a central component of the Mediterranean diet and contains beneficial polyphenols, including oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol, oleocanthal, and flavonoids, which are thought to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects [87]. Olive oil polyphenols scavenge ROS, decrease iNOS expression, decrease angiogenesis, and decrease inflammation by downregulating PPARγ and NFκB activation, as well as inflammatory cytokine production [87,88]. Treatment of human colon mucosa biopsies from patients with UC with oleuropein resulted in decreased inflammatory infiltrate, disappearance of focal cryptitis, and recovery of goblet cells [88].3.10.1. Clinical EvidenceMorvaridi et al. [40] studied the effect of EVOO consumption in patients with UC with both active and in remission disease on conventional therapy with a single-blind randomized crossover trial [40]. Subjects received 20 days of 50 mL daily EVOO followed by 14 days of washout and then 20 days of 50 mL daily canola oil (CO) or 20 days of CO followed by 14 days of washout and 20 days of EVOO. Although the change in Mayo score was not significant, bloating, constipation, fecal urgency, and incomplete defecation scores as assessed by the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale as well as ESR and hs-CRP levels significantly decreased after EVOO consumption compared to CO [40].3.10.2. Adverse EventsNo significant adverse events were reported in the study by Morvaridi et al. [40].3.10.3. Quality of EvidenceThe overall quality of evidence for the use of EVOO in UC is very low given the limited number of clinical trials with high risk of bias. Sources of bias in the study by Morvaridi et al. [40] include the subjects not being blinded to the intervention, the use of per protocol analysis, and the failure to disclose the proportion of subjects in remission vs. active disease. Although several laboratory and animal studies have elucidated the potential benefits of plant-derived polyphenols in EVOO [87], further research in UC should be encouraged given its accessibility, tolerability, and role in the Mediterranean diet.3.11. Pistacia lentiscusPistacia lentiscus(mastiha) is an evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean that is cultivated for its aromatic resin, mastic gum, and has been recognized by the European Medicines Agency for treating mild dyspepsia and wounds [41].P. lentiscusis rich in triterpenoids, which exert antioxidant effects by increasing intracellular antioxidant glutathione and anti-inflammatory effects through the downregulation of NFκB [89,90].3.11.1. Clinical EvidencePapada et al. [41] investigated the use of oralP. lentiscustablets in patients with active UC on conventional therapy for 3 months [41]. There was a significant improvement in IBDQ scores (p= 0.004) and significant decreases in fecal lysozyme (p= 0.018) and fibrinogen (p= 0.006) levels in the treatment group, while fecal lactoferrin (p= 0.001) and calprotectin (p= 0.029) levels increased in the placebo group. There was no significant difference in oxidative stress markers between groups. The trial investigated amino acid (AA) profiles given a potential link between AA profiles and IBD pathogenesis, and reported that allo-isoleucine, isoleucine, lysine, tyrosine, and tryptophan levels significantly decreased in the placebo group over time, but remained largely unchanged in the treatment group, with the exception of increased tyrosine levels [41].3.11.2. Adverse EventsNo adverse events were reported in the study by Papada et al. [41].3.11.3. Quality of EvidenceThe risk of bias of this RCT was low, but the overall level of evidence is very low given the limited data available to suggest improvement in biomarkers of intestinal inflammation and quality of life in patients with UC.3.12. Plantago majorPlantago major, also known as broadleaf plantain, is a member of the plantain family that is widely distributed around the world and has a variety of therapeutic uses in Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM) [91,92]. Its bioactive compounds, including flavonoids, alkaloids, and triterpenoids, among others, are thought to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, anti-diarrheal, and wound healing properties [91,92,93].3.12.1. Clinical EvidenceBaghizadeh et al. [42] evaluated treatment with 3600 mg/day of roastedP. majorseed capsules compared to roasted wheat flour control capsules on gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with UC (active or remission) on conventional therapy [42]. Abdominal tenderness (p= 0.011), gastroesophageal reflux (p= 0.049), and gastric pain (p= 0.049) significantly decreased in the treatment group compared to control. Although there was no significant difference in visible blood in the stool between the two groups, the treatment group experienced a significant decrease in visible blood compared to baseline after 8 weeks (p= 0.001), while the control group exhibited no significant improvement (p= 0.331). Diarrhea, nocturnal diarrhea, fecal incontinence, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, anal pain, and well-being were not significantly different between groups at 8 weeks [42].3.12.2. Adverse EventsNo adverse events were reported in the study by Baghizadeh et al. [42].3.12.3. Quality of EvidenceThe quality of evidence is very low given the limited data available to suggest thatP. majorin addition to conventional therapy may help alleviate some gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with UC.3.13. Punica granatumPomegranate (Punica granatum) is a fruiting shrub native to the Middle East and India and has been used medicinally for inflammation, ulcers, and diarrhea [43]. Pomegranate peel is rich in polyphenols and its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, and wound healing potential has been attributed to flavonoids, hydrolyzable tannins, and metabolic products of ellagitannins [43,94,95]. Pomegranate peel has been found to increase antioxidant enzymes, regulate the gut microbiome, and downregulate iNOS, COX-2, MAPK, NFκB, and inflammatory cytokine production [95,96].3.13.1. Clinical EvidenceKamali et al. [43] investigated the use of 8 mL pomegranate peel extract containing 6 g of pomegranate peel daily compared to placebo in patients with moderate UC taking conventional therapy [43]. They found that the rate of clinical response was significantly higher in the treatment group compared to placebo at week 4 (41.4% vs. 18.2%,p= 0.055), but not at week 10 (48.3% vs. 36.4%,p= 0.441). Both groups had significant reductions in mean Lichtiger Colitis Activity Index (LCAI) scores. At week 10, there was a significant improvement in fecal incontinence (p= 0.031) and general well-being (p= 0.013) in the treatment group, while there was only an improvement in general well-being (p= 0.004) in the placebo group [43].3.13.2. Adverse EventsAdverse events were mild (i.e., urticaria, nausea, increased appetite) and not significantly different between groups in the study by Kamali et al. [43].3.13.3. Quality of EvidenceThese promising results suggest that pomegranate peel may have potential for improving clinical response rates as an added therapy. However, the overall quality of evidence is low. Limitations of the study by Kamali et al. include a small sample size, possibly resulting in an underpowered study and the use of a per protocol analysis, although it was noted that those who discontinued the study were not significantly different with regard to demographics or symptoms when compared with those remaining in the study.3.14. Rose OilRose oil is produced by soaking rose petals, mainlyRosa damascena(damask rose) andRosa centifolia(cabbage rose), in carrier oils such as sesame oil [44]. Damask rose petals contain flavonoids, polyphenols, vitamin C, and the monoterpene geraniol, which have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects, lending to its use in TPM for a variety of ailments including digestive disorders [44,97]. In a murine colitis model, oral geraniol administration reduced disease activity index (DAI), improved stool consistency, decreased inflammatory cytokine and MPO activity in colon cells, demonstrated the downregulation of NFκB, iNOS, and COX-2, and increased glutathione and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity [98].3.14.1. Clinical EvidenceTavakoli et al. [44] evaluated the use of rose oil capsules in patients with moderate to severe UC on conventional therapy [44]. Partial Mayo and IBDQ-9 scores decreased significantly in both groups over time, but there was no significant difference between groups [44]. There was a non-significant decrease in fecal calprotectin in both groups [44].3.14.2. Adverse EventsThere was no difference in mild gastrointestinal side effects between groups in the study by Tavakoli et al. [44].3.14.3. Quality of EvidenceThe high attrition rate (30%) is a limitation of the study by Tavakoli et al. [44], with 10% and 15% in the treatment and control groups, respectively, withdrawing from the study due to gastrointestinal discomfort. The study showed no significant difference in outcomes between treatment and control groups at the end of the study period. The evidence for the use of rose oil in UC is very low.3.15. SaffronSaffron is a culinary spice cultivated from the stigma ofCrocus sativusflowers, which are grown in the Mediterranean and Asia. Saffron is thought to have several therapeutic applications with memory-improving, anti-depressant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-tumor effects, which are attributed to the major bioactive compounds including the carotenoids crocetin, crocin, safranal, and picrocrocin [45,46]. The proposed antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms of these compounds include increasing glutathione, antioxidant enzyme, and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activity, as well as decreasing iNOS, NFκB, and inflammatory cytokine expression [45,99]. Murine colitis models have suggested that crocin can ameliorate wound healing and inflammation in chemically induced colitis and suppress colitis-associated carcinogenesis [45,99].3.15.1. Clinical EvidenceWe identified one RCT that investigated the effects of oral saffron on oxidative stress in mild to moderate UC, with outcome data presented in two articles [45,46]. The treatment group had a significantly greater reduction in mean SCCAI scores and a significantly greater increase in SOD, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and glutathione levels compared to control at 8 weeks [46]. Significant decreases in TNFα and hs-CRP levels, as well as an increase in IL-10 (p= 0.004) levels were reported in the treatment group compared to control [45]. There were no differences in ESR, IL-17, and IBDQ-9 between groups, although there were significant decreases in ESR (p= 0.02) and IL-17 (p= 0.001), as well as an increase in IBDQ-9 (p= 0.013) in the treatment group after 8 weeks [45].3.15.2. Adverse EventsThere were no adverse events reported in the included studies. Saffron is thought to be safe at doses of 1.5 g/day, although doses greater than 5 g/kg/day are considered toxic [46].3.15.3. Quality of EvidenceCurrent available evidence is limited, making the quality of evidence low. However, these promising results suggest that saffron as an added therapy can improve mean SCCAI scores and inflammatory and antioxidant markers in UC. In addition, the accessibility and safety of saffron as a culinary spice should encourage further investigation for the potential use of saffron in UC.3.16. Thymus kotschyanusThymus kotschyanusis an aromatic perennial herb native to the Mediterranean, of which the aerial parts have been used in TPM for a variety of ailments due to its antispasmodic, antibacterial, and antioxidant effects [47,100]. The oil components, including thymol, carvacol, and geraniol, among others, contain flavonoids, polyphenols, anthocyanins, and other bioactive polyphenols [47]. The monoterpene thymol has exhibited anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antitumor potential through free radical scavenging [101], cyto/genotoxic effects on colorectal cancer cells [102], NFκB and MAPK inhibition, and downregulation of COX-2 expression, inflammatory cytokine production, and NO production in murine colitis models and in vitro studies [47,103].3.16.1. Clinical EvidenceVazirian et al. [47] investigated the use ofThymus kotschyanuscapsules in patients with mild to moderate UC on stable doses of mesalamine [47]. At 12 weeks, the treatment group had a significantly lower mean fecal calprotectin level and median SCCAI score when compared to placebo, while there was no difference in median SIBDQ score, Seo index, ESR (p= 0.572), or CRP (p= 0.160) [47].3.16.2. Adverse EventsOnly mild adverse events, including mouth ulcers and bloating, were reported, with no significant difference between groups in the study by Vazirian et al. [47]. No serious adverse events were reported.3.16.3. Quality of EvidenceThere was a significant baseline difference in mean SIBDQ score between groups at the outset of the study by Vazirian et al. [47], which may have influenced outcomes. Other limitations of this study include a small sample size, attrition rate, and lack of clarity if a per protocol or intention to treat approach was used to analyze outcomes.A variety of plants, including thyme and oregano, contain thymol, carvacrol, and thyme polyphenols. Thyme and oregano are regarded as safe with negligible toxicity by the US Food and Drug Administration [102]. Although the quality of the existing evidence for treatment in UC is very low, further investigation of plants containing thyme oil may be beneficial given the accessibility, general safety and tolerability, and promising results from laboratory and animal studies.3.17. WheatgrassWheatgrass is the sprouted leaves of the wheat plant,Triticum aestivum, which is grown in North America and Europe and has been used in indigenous healing [104]. Its therapeutic qualities have been attributed to chlorophyll, vitamins C and E, and flavonoids, such as apigenin, which have anticarcinogenic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects [48,104,105].3.17.1. Clinical EvidenceBen-Ayre et al. [48] investigated the use of wheatgrass juice in UC patients with sigmoidoscopic evidence of left colon involvement [48]. They reported significant differences in rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, DAI score, physician global assessment, and patients’ retrospective evaluation (p= 0.0053) in the treatment group compared to placebo [48]. Sigmoidoscopic improvement was not statistically significant between groups, although 7/9 subjects in the treatment group showed improvement, compared to 3/10 in the placebo group [48].3.17.2. Adverse EventsMild reported adverse events in the study by Ben-Ayre et al. [48] included nausea, decreased appetite, and constipation [48].3.17.3. Quality of EvidenceA limitation of the study by Ben-Arye et al. [48] was that 6/11 and 2/12 patients in the treatment and placebo groups, respectively, believed they were getting wheatgrass, suggesting that participant blinding may not have been effective. Although the risk of bias was low in this RCT, the overall quality of evidence is very low given limited available data.3.18. Zingiber officinaleZingiber officinale, or ginger, has been prevalent in herbal medicine for centuries and used for various conditions in Ayurveda, TCM, and TPM [106]. The therapeutic qualities of ginger can be attributed to its bioactive terpene and phenolic compounds, such as gingerols, zingiberene, and shogaols [106]. Murine colitis models and in vitro studies suggest that the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities of ginger are due to the inhibition of NFκB, increased production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, decreased production of inflammatory cytokines, and increased levels of SOD and glutathione [106]. Ginger has also been found to have antimicrobial and anticarciniogenic effects [106] and can modulate the gut microbiome by increasing short chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria, which are thought to be anti-inflammatory [107].3.18.1. Clinical EvidenceNikkhah-Bodaghi et al. [49] studied the use of 2000 mg ginger powder capsules in two divided doses with meals daily vs. placebo in 64 patients with mild to moderate UC [49]. Average SCCAI score was significantly decreased in the ginger group compared to placebo at 12 weeks [49]. Although there was no difference in TAC, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were significantly decreased in the ginger group and compared to placebo at 12 weeks [49].3.18.2. Adverse EventsThere were no adverse events reported in the study by Nikkhah-Bodaghi et al. [49].3.18.3. Quality of EvidenceWhile the risk of bias of this RCT was determined to be low, it is difficult to make definitive conclusions on the effects of ginger on UC given the small number of studies available. However, given that ginger is accessible, prevalent in cooking, and generally tolerable, further research should be encouraged to expand on these promising findings suggesting that ginger can improve SCCAI scores and antioxidant markers in UC."

            "conclusion": [
                "Our study has several strengths including a rigorous methodology for systematic review and meta-analysis, a focus on RCTs to present the highest quality evidence available, and a comprehensive review including 18 different herbal medicines. However, our study is not without limitations. To provide a focused review of the treatment of active UC, we did not include studies of patients in remission, who may also benefit from herbal medicines. This review does not include preclinical, in vitro, pilot, observational, and other study designs, which may have limited the amount of evidence identified in our literature search. While our study focuses on individual herbs, we recognize that this is not inclusive of combination herbal formulations which are likely more representative of the traditional healing practices from which they originated. Many of these herbs have been traditionally used in countries outside of the United States or Europe, so a greater body of literature may be published in languages other than English and were, unfortunately, not able to be included in our review.Given the prevalence of herbal supplement use in the US, it is imperative that healthcare providers are educated on how to guide their patients in safe herbal medicine use. Providers should be aware of resources to vet herbal supplements, such as the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database available online or the National Institute of Health’s HerbList smartphone application. It is also crucial for patients and providers to be familiar with herbal supplement companies that have appropriate manufacturing practices and are transparent in their compound sourcing, ingredients, and techniques to verify potency and test for contaminants. More stringent federal and industry-led regulatory practices should be encouraged to ensure the safe production and use of herbal medicines.We identified several herbs with the potential to expand the armamentarium of treatment options in UC. The promising results highlighted in this review and the growing popularity of herbal supplement use necessitates investment in research with larger scale and higher quality RCTs. As we begin to develop a larger body of evidence obtained with rigorous methodology, we can gain confidence in the efficacy and safety of herbal medicines and develop meaningful evidence-based recommendations for their use in the treatment of ulcerative colitis."

                "The bio-mediated synthesis of nanoparticles offers a sustainable and eco-friendly approach. In the present study, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized using Joshanda extract, a commercially available herbal formulation derived from a traditional medicinal plant, as a reducing and stabilizing agent. The as-synthesized AgNPs were characterized using UV–Vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), X-ray Diffraction (XRD) study, and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) analysis. UV–Vis spectroscopy exhibited a prominent absorption peak at 430 nm, confirming the formation of AgNPs. DLS analysis revealed the size distribution of the nanoparticles, ranging from 80 to 100 nm, and zeta potential measurements indicated a surface charge of − 14.4 mV. The XRD analysis provide evidence for the presence of a face-centered cubic structure within the silver nanoparticles. FTIR analysis further elucidated the interaction of bioactive compounds from the Joshanda extract with the AgNPs’ surface. Strong peaks at 765–829 cm−1indicated C–Cl stretching vibrations of alkyl halides, while the stretching of alkenes C=C was observed at 1641 cm−1. Moreover, the presence of alcohols and phenol (OH) groups was identified at 3448 cm−1, suggesting their involvement in nanoparticle stabilization. The antimicrobial potential of the synthesized AgNPs was evaluated against both gram-negativePseudomonas aeruginosaand gram-positiveStreptococcus mutansusing zone of inhibition assays. The AgNPs exhibited remarkable inhibitory effects against both types of bacteria. Additionally, AgNPs-treated groups demonstrated a significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, indicating potential of as-synthesized AgNPs in disruption of the target microbial membranes. Furthermore, the as-synthesized AgNPs exhibited notable anti-biofilm properties by effectively hindering the development of mature biofilms. This study highlights the efficient green synthesis of AgNPs using Joshanda extract and also provides insights into their physico-chemical properties of as-synthesized nanoparticles. The demonstrated antimicrobial activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, along with biofilm inhibition potential, underscores the promising applications of the as-synthesized AgNPs in the field of biomedical and environmental sciences. The study bridges traditional knowledge with contemporary nanotechnology, offering a novel avenue for the development of eco-friendly antimicrobial agents.Graphical abstract"

                "Atractylodes lancea(Thunb.) DC. (A.lancea: AL) is a promising candidate for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer). The study investigated (i) the propensity of capsule formulation of the standardized extract of AL (formulated AL) to modulate mRNA and protein expression and activities of CYP1A2 and CYP3A1 in rats after long- and short-term exposure, (ii) the pharmacokinetics of atractylodin (ATD: active constituent) after long-term administration of formulated AL, and (iii) the biodistribution of atractylodin-loaded polylactic-co-glycolic acid (ATD-PLGA-NPs) in mice. To investigate CYP1A2 and CYP3A1 modulatory activities following long-term exposure, rats of both genders received oral doses of the formulated AL at 1,000 (low dose), 3,000 (medium dose), and 5,000 (high dose) mg/kg body weight daily for 12 months. For short-term effects, male rats were orally administered the formulated AL at the dose of 5,000 mg/kg body weight daily for 1, 7, 14 and 21 days. The pharmacokinetic study was conducted in male rats after administration of the formulated AL at the dose of 5,000 mg/kg body weight daily for 9 months. The biodistribution study was conducted in a male mouse receiving ATD-PLGA-NPs at the equivalent dose to ATD of 100 mg/kg body weight. The high dose of formulated AL produced an inducing effect on CYP1A2 but an inhibitory effect on CYP3A1 activities in male rats. The low dose, however, did not inhibit or induce the activities of both enzymes in male and female rats. ATD reached maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of 359.73 ng/mL at 3 h (tmax). Mean residence time (MRT) and terminal phase elimination half-life (t1/2z) were 3.03 and 0.56 h, respectively. The extent of biodistribution of ATD in mouse livers receiving ATD-PLGA-NPs was 5-fold of that receiving free ATD. Clinical use of low-dose AL should be considered to avoid potential herb-drug interactions after long-term use. ATD-PLGA-NPs is a potential drug delivery system for cholangiocarcinoma treatment."

                "Herbal medicine is increasingly being used in clinical practice worldwide for various indications [1–3]. Herbal products have been considered safe as they have been used for a long time in the past decades. Due to their complex chemical constituents, however, potential adverse interactions are the major concern when they are concomitantly administered with other herbal or modern medicines. The cytochrome P450s (CYP450s) are mixed-function oxidases that play a crucial role in the biotransformation of xeno- and endobiotics, as well as drug-drug and herb-drug interactions [4]. Although human CYP450s are present in various organs, most are expressed in the liver, with the highest expressed isoforms being CYP3A4, followed by CYP2C9/2C19, CYP1A2, and CYP2E1 [5,6]. The most liable CYP450 isoform for the metabolism of currently used drugs is CYP3A4 (50%), followed by CYP2D6 (30%), CYP2C9/2C19 (11%), and CYP1A2 (4%) [6]. Inhibition of CYP450 metabolizing enzymes result in increased plasma/blood concentrations of the co-administered drugs and the risk of toxicity, particularly for narrow therapeutic index drugs [4]. Induction of CYP450s, on the other hand, leads to decreased plasma/blood concentrations of the co-administered drugs, leading to the loss of their pharmacological efficacy [4].Atractylodes lancea(Thunb.) DC. (A.lancea: AL) is a promising candidate for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer). It has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for rheumatic diseases, digestive disorders, night blindness, and influenza [7]. Results from our previous studies, bothin vitroandin vivo, confirm the potential anti-cholangiocarcinoma activity and safety profile of dried rhizomes extract and capsule formulation of the standardized AL extract (formulated AL) [8]. The IC50(half-maximal inhibitory concentration) values of the crude and formulated AL in human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines range from 23.24 ± 0.35 to 69.19 ± 3.85 μg/mL (mean ± SD) [9–11]. The anti-cholangiocarcinoma activity of AL extract (daily oral dose levels of 1,000, 3,000 and 5,000 mg/kg body weight) has also been confirmed in animal models, both in the xenograft mice andOpisthorchis viverrini/dimethylnitrosamine-induced cholangiocarcinoma in hamsters [12,13]. Furthermore, the potential inhibitory effect of AL on CYP450 activities was investigatedin vitro[14]. The extract potently inhibited CYP1A2 (IC500.36 ± 0.02 μg/mL). The inhibitory potency for CYP2C19 was moderate (IC5016.48 ± 1.04 μg/mL), while the inhibitory potencies for CYP2D6 (IC50313.51± 51.90 μg/mL) and CYP3A4 (IC5054.36±5.64 μg/mL) were low [14]. Phase I clinical trial to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of the formulated AL has been completed [15]. Results suggest a satisfactory safety profile when given orally at a single or daily dose of 1,000 mg [15]. Atractylodin (ATD: active compound) was well absorbed, reaching maximum concentration (tmax) within 1 hour. The elimination half-life (t1/2) was short (1.23 hours) [15]. Phase II clinical trial in patients with advanced stage cholangiocarcinoma is underway. As long-term administration of AL is required for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma, assessments of potential drug interactions and pharmacokinetics are essential. The current study aimed to investigate modulatory effects of the formulated AL on CYP450, and the pharmacokinetics of atractylodin (ATD) in animals. ATD is the active constituent of AL which has also been reported for anti-proliferative activity against cholangiocarcinoma cell lines [16]. The propensity of the AL formulation to modulate mRNA and protein expression and activities of CYP1A2 and CYP3A1 enzymes was investigated in rats following long- and short-term administration of AL. The pharmacokinetics of atractylodin was investigated in rats following daily doses of AL formulation for 9 months. Due to the poor solubility of ATD which might affect the bioavailability of the compound, the bioavailability and biodistribution of the polylactic-co-glycolic acid nanoparticles of ATD (ATD-PLGA-NPs) were investigated in mouse liver using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-imaging mass spectrometer (MALDI-IMS). The ATD-PLGA-NPs was previously developed in our laboratory with the aim of improving the solubility, and thusin vivobioavailability and biodistribution of ATD [16]. The antiproliferative activity of ATD-PLGA-NPs against cholangiocarcinoma cell lines was shown to be relatively potent with an IC50ranging from 16 to 23 μg/mL and selective distribution to liver [16]."

                "The dose levels of formulated AL used for the investigation of CYP450 modulatory activities and pharmacokinetic studies (1,000, 3,000, and 5,000 mg/kg body weight) and biodistribution study (100 mg/kg body weight of ATD) were selected based on the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and no observed adverse effect (NOAEL) levels reported from the subacute toxicity studies [12,13,18].CYP3A4 is the CYP450 isoform that contributes to the metabolism of 50% of the marketed drugs. In addition, the rat liver contains the CYP450 isoenzymes which are clinically relevant to human CYP450, including CYP1A and CYP3A [20,21]. The potent inhibitory effect of AL extract on human CYP1A2 was shown in our previous study [14]. For these reasons, rat liver CYP1A2 and CYP3A1 isoforms (homologs to human CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, respectively) were selected for investigation of the modulatory effects of the formulated AL on CYP450 metabolizing enzymes in the current study. Long-term modulatory effects of the formulated AL on CYP1A2 and CYP3A1 expression (mRNA and proteins) and activities were initially investigated in male and female WT rat livers following exposure to the formulated AL at the daily oral doses of 1,000 (low dose), 3,000 (medium dose), and 5,000 (high dose) mg/kg body weight for 12 months. Results showed both inducing and inhibitory effects of AL on the expression of CYP1A2 and CYP3A1 mRNA and proteins in male and female rats in a dose-independent manner. For CYP450 enzyme activities, male rats receiving formulated AL at the high daily dose level of 5,000 mg/kg body weight showed significant induction of CYP1A2, while inhibition of CYP3A1. Lower dose levels of the formulated AL (1,000 and 3,000 mg/kg body weight) did not significantly inhibit nor induce both CYP1A2 and CYP3A1 activities in the livers of both male and female rats. This suggests the dose-dependent inducing or inhibitory effect of AL on the activity of both enzymes. The observed lack of correlation between the modulatory effects on mRNA and protein expression and enzyme activities may suggest direct interference of AL with the enzyme activity. The results also provide evidence of sex differences in the modulatory effects of AL. It was noted, however, that, although the results of the phase I study reported a nonsignificant difference in pharmacokinetic parameters of ATD between male and female subjects, Cmaxand AUC were slightly higher in females particularly after multiple dose administration [15]. The modulatory effect of formulated AL at the high dose level of 5,000 mg/kg body weight was further investigated in male SD rats following short-term exposure. Interestingly, results showed similar findings as that were found following long-term exposure,i.e., inhibitory effect on CYP3A1 but inducing effect on CYP1A2 activity. It was noted, however, for the inhibitory effect on CYP1A2 activity in rats treated with formulated AL for 1 day, similarly to that observed in the previousin vitrostudy [14]. This suggests a time-dependent inducing or inhibitory effect of the formulated AL on CYP450 activity. Since CYP1A2 activity was well correlated with mRNA and protein expression, the change in the activity of this enzyme is likely to be a result of an increase in mRNA and protein expression, but not the direct interference of AL with the enzyme activity. In contrast, the activity of CYP3A1 was not correlated with both mRNA and protein expression, which may indicate direct interference of AL with the enzyme activity. The current investigation of CYP450 modulatory activities was a part of a large study to evaluate chronic toxicity (long-term exposure) and to identify the metabolic pathway (short-term exposure) of the formulated AL. Different strains of rats were, therefore, used in the current study to avoid unnecessary inclusion of additional animals for the study. Hepatic CYP1A and CYP3A were shown to be prevailing expressed in WT rats compared with SD rats [22]. However, this should not affect the results and interpretation as the comparison was made with control or placebo.Human CYP1A2 metabolizes various drugs,e.g., phenacetin, tacrine, ropinirole, acetaminophen, theophylline, caffeine, and various pre-carcinogens,e.g., benzo[a]pyrene, and aflatoxin B1[20,23,24]. Induction in CYP1A2 was shown to enhance the activation of pre-carcinogen to a carcinogen [23]. CYP1A2 induction is under the transcriptional regulation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). The process of induction involves the interaction of AhR/ARNT (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator) complex with upstream enhancer components. This is followed by the transmission of induction signal to promotor and subsequent transcription of mRNA and translocation to corresponding protein [25,26]. CYP3A4 is liable for the biotransformation of several drugs; some of them,e.g. carbamazepine, cyclosporine, digoxin and tacrolimus, are drugs with narrow therapeutic index values [27]. Although rat CYP1A2 and CYP3A1 are orthologues of human CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, differences in inducing and inhibitory effects and catalytic activities are possible.The pharmacokinetic study in rats after long-term multiple daily dosing of formulated AL showed slightly prolonged tmaxand MRT compared with that were observed in humans [15]. This suggests slower absorption of ATD from the gastrointestinal tract of rats. ATD was rapidly eliminated within 6 hours of dosing in both rats and humans [15]. Improvement in the bioavailability and biodistribution of ATD has been well demonstrated when ATD was formulated as ATD-PLGA-NPs [16]. The prepared ATD-PLGA-NPs showed comparable %EE and %LE compared with that reported in the previous study. The time of liver sample collection was selected based on the information provided in the previous study showing the maximum level of distribution of ATD-PLGA-NPs to the liver at 4 hours after administration [16]. MALDI-IMS analysis confirmed a relatively high extent of ATD distribution when administered as ATD-PLGA-NPs compared with unencapsulated ATD. This could be due to the improved bioavailability of ATD-PLGA-NPs. The nanoparticle size is sufficiently small to be absorbed and distributed to the target site. MALDI-IMS has become a widely used method for molecular tissue and morphological analysis due to high sensitivity, wide range of molecules, and molecular specificity [28]. The study was the first that investigated the localization of ATD in mice livers using MALDI-IMS.Formulated AL and ATD are potential candidates and are currently under research and development for cholangiocarcinoma treatment [8,16,29]. Phase I clinical trial of AL showed promising safety and pharmacokinetic profiles [15], as well as immunomodulatory activity in healthy Thai subjects [30]. Phase II dose-finding study is currently in progress to find the most effective dose in patients with advanced stage cholangiocarcinoma. The results of the current study thus provide important information to aid the design of an optimal dose regimen of the formulated AL for cholangiocarcinoma patients. Clinical use of the maximum dose of 5,000 mg/kg body weight should be of concern for the potential of metabolic interactions with therapeutic drugs currently co-administered with AL, particularly those metabolized by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. This is of concern, considering the requirement for long-term administration of AL in patients with cholangiocarcinoma. Moreover, the results of pharmacokinetic investigation after long-term administration could support long-term use in humans. The ATD-PLGA-NPs formulation could be a promising drug delivery system to improve the bioavailability of ATD at the target sites of action in cholangiocarcinoma patients."

All animals were obtained from Nomura Siam International Co. Ltd. and were housed at the Laboratory Animal Center, Thammasat University, in environmentally controlled room temperature (22±2°C) with a 12 h light-dark cycle and 30–70% humidity. The experiments were conducted following the approved protocol from the Ethics Committee for Animal Research, Thammasat University, Thailand (No. 019/2560 for rats and No. 016/2020 for mice) and in accordance to the Guideline for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals [17].Modulatory effects of formulated AL on CYP1A2 and CYP3A1 expression and activitiesExperimental design and treatments.CYP1A2 and CYP3A1 modulatory effects of the formulated AL were investigated in WT rats following long- and short-term exposure (Experiment IandExperiment II, respectively).Experiment I (long-term exposure). The investigation of long-term modulatory effects of the formulated AL onCYP1A2andCYP3A1expression and activities was a part of the chronic toxicity testing [18]. Rats were assigned to four groups (3 males and 3 females each) to receive treatment with the formulated ALviaintragastric gavage once daily for 12 months as follows: group 1 (low dose) 1,000 mg/kg body weight; group 2 (medium dose) 3,000 mg/kg body weight; group 3 (high dose) 5,000 mg/kg body weight; and group 4 (control) distilled water.Experiment II (short-term exposure). For the investigation of the short-term effect of the formulated AL onCYP1A2andCYP3A1expression and activities, male SD rats were assigned to four experimental groups (3 rats each) to receive treatment with formulated AL at daily doses of 5,000 mg/kg body weightviaintragastric gavage for 1 (group 1), 7 (group 2), 14 (group 3), and 21 (group 4) days. The corresponding controlled groups (3 rats each) received treatment with placebo.Effects of formulated AL on CYP1A2 and CYP3A1 mRNA expression.Total mRNA was prepared from rats’ liver according to the manufacturer’s instruction (S1 Appendix). CYP1A2 and CYP3A1 mRNA expression levels in rat liver tissues isolated from both experiments were determined using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Specific forward and reverse primers of the target and housekeeping genes used in the experiment are presented inTable 1. iTaqTMUniversal SYBR®Green Supermix was used for RT-PCR analysis using CFX ConnectTMReal-Time System (BioRad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, USA).

The expression levels of CYP1A2 and CYP3A1 proteins in rat liver tissues were examined by Western immunoblots analysis. The prepared microsomal proteins were denatured at 100°C for 5 min, separated onto 12.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (25 μg proteinperlane) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblot analysis. The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris Buffered Saline (TBS, pH 7.4) and incubated at 4°C overnight with primary antibodies against CYP1A2, CYP3A1, and GAPDH. After washing with TBS containing 0.1% TWEEN-20 (TBST), the membrane was incubated with an AP-linked secondary antibody at 25°C. The membrane was washed with TBST and incubated with AP chromogen (BCIP/NBT) system to detect the interested protein bands and photographed using UVP ChemStudio (Analytik Jena, Germany). Intensity analysis of protein bands was performed using Image J software (NIH). The housekeeping control, GAPDH, was used for protein level normalization.Effects of formulated AL on CYP1A2 and CYP3A1 activities.Phenacetin and nifedipine, the substrates of CYP1A2 and CYP3A1, respectively, were used for investigation of the modulatory effects of AL on both enzymes [14]. The concentrations of rat liver microsomal proteins used in the incubation reaction were 0.5 and 0.3 mg/mL for CYP1A2 and CYP3A1, respectively (linear range of optimized protein concentration). The concentrations of phenacetin and nifedipine used were 20 μM and 40 μM, respectively.The incubation mixture (500 μL) containing rat liver microsome (in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) and selective substrate was pre-incubated at 37°C for 5 min. After the addition of 1 mM NADPH, the reaction was further incubated for 60 and 40 min for CYP1A2 and CYP3A1 activities, respectively. Cold methanol (450 μL) was added to terminate the reaction, and 50 μL of caffeine and diazepam (the internal standard for CYP1A2 and CYP3A1, respectively) were added. After centrifugation (12,000xg, 15 min, 4°C), 20 μL of the supernatant were injected onto HPLC-UV for determination of paracetamol (CYP1A2 metabolite) and dehydronifedipine (CYP3A1 metabolite) concentrations. The HPLC system consisted of 1260 Quaternary pump VL, equipped with a 1260 ALS autosampler, 1260 DAD VL detector (Agilent Technologies), and OpenLAB CDS Software (version C.01.04). The column used for paracetamol and dehydronifedipine separation was a reversed-phase C-18 column (Thermo Hypersil Gold, 210 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm). The mobile phase for paracetamol determination consisted of water and methanol running at the gradient ratio of 20% methanol for 1 min, 45% methanol for 8 min, and 20% methanol for 7 min. The flow rate and UV detection were 1.0 mL/min and 240 nm, respectively.The mobile phase for dehydronifedipine determination consisted of water and methanol (30%:70% v/v) running at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. UV detection was at 235 nm. The calibration curve concentrations for both CYP450-mediated metabolites was in the range of 1–50 μM, with correlation coefficients (r2) greater than 0.995. Quality control samples at low, medium and high concentrations were run together with each analytical batch. All analyses lay within 100±15% of the nominal values.Pharmacokinetic studyTreatment and blood sample collection.The pharmacokinetic study was conducted in three male WT rats following daily long-term multiple doses of 5,000 mg/kg body weight AL formulation for 9 months. Blood samples were collected from the tail vein at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours after the last dose. Plasma was immediately separated through centrifugation at 3,000xgfor 10 min (4°C).Determination of ATD concentration.ATD was used as an active marker for the pharmacokinetic investigation of the formulated AL. Liquid-liquid extraction was applied for sample preparation. Briefly, the aliquot of pooled plasma from all rats (500 μL) was mixed with 10 μL of internal standard, 1,8-dihydroxyantraquinone. Protein contents were precipitated by adding 1 mL of acetonitrile and thoroughly mixed. After centrifugation (5,000xg, 20 min), the supernatant was transferred to a 15 mL tube, and 2 mL of dichloromethane was added and thoroughly mixed on a rotator for 30 min. The organic layer (lower layer) was transferred to a new tube and dried under nitrogen steam at room temperature.Plasma concentrations of ATD in all samples were measured using HPLC according to the previously described method [15]. The HPLC system used was the same as previously described for CYP1A2 and CYP3A1 activities. The residue was reconstituted with 100 μL of acetonitrile and filtered through a 0.22 μm nylon filter membrane, and a 40 μL aliquot was subjected to the column. The mobile phase consisted of water and acetonitrile with a ratio of 30%:70% v/v, running at the flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. UV detection was set at 340 nm. The calibration curve (2.5–500 ng/mL) showed linearity with correlation coefficients (r2) greater than 0.995. Quality control samples at low, medium and high concentrations were run together with each analytical batch. All analyses lay within 100±15% of the nominal values.The pharmacokinetic parameters of ATD were estimated using a non-compartmental model (Phoenix/WinNonlin version 8.3, Pharsight Corporation. 2016, Cary, North Carolina, USA). Maximum drug concentration in plasma (Cmax) and time to Cmax(tmax) were directly obtained from plasma concentration-time data. The total area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0−∞) was calculated using the trapezoidal rule. The extrapolated AUC of the last sampling point to infinity was estimated by CT/elimination rate constant (λz). The extrapolation was less than 5% of total areas in all cases. The total area under the first moment curve of the plasma concentration-time profile from time zero to infinity (AUMC0-∞) were determined, and mean residence time (MRT) was calculated from the ratio of AUMC0-∞/AUC0−∞.Biodistribution of ATD-PLGA-NPsPreparation of ATD-PLGA-NPs and determination of ATD encapsulation and loading efficiencies.ATD-PLGA-NPs was formulated by solvent displacement method [16]. The encapsulation efficiency (%EE) and loading efficiency (%LE) were determined according to the protocol described inS3 Appendix.Treatment and preparation of liver tissues.A male mouse was treated with a single dose of ATD-PLGA-NPs equivalent to 100 mg/kg body weight of ATD. The mouse was sacrificed under CO2,and the liver sample was collected after 4 hours of dosing. The sample was rinsed with cold normal saline and sectioned (20 μm width) at -20°C using Cryostat Microtome (CM1950, Leica, Germany) and placed on ITO-coated glass slide. The cut tissue was stained with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid under iMLayer (Shimadzu, Japan). The corresponding control mouse was treated with free ATD at the same dose.MALDI-IMS analysis.MS images of the distribution of ATD in mouse liver were investigated using Imaging Mass Microscope (IMS) (iMScope TRIO, Shimadzu, Japan) in positive mode with a pitch of 36 μm for both x and y direction and mass to charge ratio range of 180–185, at a laser frequency of 1,000 Hz with 100 of shots. The sample and detector voltages were set at 3.50 kV and 2.00 kV, respectively, and the laser intensity was 15. The images of liver tissues were captured, and the amount of ATD in the liver was calculated and reported as intensity.Statistical analysisSPSS software version 25 (IBM, NY, USA) was applied for all statistical analyses. The quantitative data are expressed as median (95% CI) for non-normally distributed data. The differences between each treatment and control or placebo groups were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. The statistical significance level was set at ⍺ = 0.05 for all tests."

                "The formulated AL at the highest dose level of 5,000 mg/kg body weight produced inducing and inhibitory effects on CYP1A2 and CYP3A1 in the livers of male rats following short- (up to 21 days) and long-term (12 months) treatment. The low dose levels did not inhibit or induce the activities of both enzymes in male and female rats. These low dose levels should be considered for clinical use of AL to avoid potential herb-drug interaction. The ATD-PLGA-NPs nanoformulation is a potential drug delivery system for cholangiocarcinoma treatment."

                ":Diabetes is called a “wasting and thirsting disorder” in Chinese traditional medicine because there is a depletion of vital substances in the body independent of the intake of food or water and an inability to reintroduce fluids through drinking.Pueraria lobata(Willd.) Ohwi (GG) andPueraria thomsoniiBenth. (FG) are traditional Chinese herbal medicines used in the treatment of wasting-thirst that reduce blood glucose levels. Flavonoids are the main pharmacodynamic components of GG and FG, and they are also the most studied components at present, but polysaccharides are also active components of GG and FG, which, however, are less studied. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect ofPuerariapolysaccharides (GG and FG polysaccharides) on type 2 diabetes (T2D), as well as their related mechanisms of action in terms of both intestinal flora and metabolomics. The C57BL/KsJ-db/db mouse model, a well-established model of obesity-induced T2D, was used in this study. The metabolomic analysis showed thatPuerariapolysaccharides improved the metabolic profile of diabetic mice and significantly regulated metabolites and metabolic pathways. Both GG and FG polysaccharides regulated insulin resistance in mice by regulating PPAR signaling pathway so as to treat T2D. Additionally,Puerariapolysaccharides regulated the structure of gut microbiota and improved the diabetes-related metabolic pathway. Therefore, this study discovered the antidiabetic effects and potential mechanisms ofPuerariapolysaccharides through multiple pathways involving gut microbiota and metabolites, providing a theoretical basis for further studies on their effects in the treatment of T2D."

            "Introduction": [
                "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and relative insulin deficiency, accounting for 90% of all cases of diabetes [1]. The prevalence and incidence of T2D have increased rapidly around the world in recent years. According to statistics from the 10th edition of the Global Diabetes Overview in 2021, 537 million people worldwide suffer from diabetes, and the number is expected to rise to 643 million by 2030 [2]. The etiology and mechanism of diabetes are very complicated and have not been completely clarified. It has been reported that the metabolites of T2D mice are significantly different compared to healthy mice, and the differential metabolites are involved in the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathways, the glycerol metabolism pathway [3], the arachidonic acid metabolism pathway, and the linoleic acid metabolism pathway [4]. Retinol binding protein 4 is produced by the liver and adipose tissue and plays a physiological role in the transport of vitamin A (retinol), as well as an important role in insulin resistance [5]. In addition, the intestinal microbiota, consisting of 1013–1014 bacteria, is closely related to diabetes progression [6]. The imbalance of the intestinal flora affects the metabolism of endogenous substances, such as short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, and other metabolic pathways, leading to the occurrence of diabetes [7]. A study on the intestinal flora in T2D revealed that the abundance of Firmicutes in patients with diabetes is significantly lower than in normal people [8], while the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Klebsiella are higher than those in normal people [9], thereby increasing the prevalence of insulin resistance [10]. Thus, the combination of the evaluation of gut microbiota and metabolomics might represent an effective approach to studying the pathogenesis of T2D and the mechanism of action of therapeutic drugs.Pueraria lobata(Willd.) Ohwi (GG) andPueraria thomsoniiBenth. (FG) are traditional Chinese herbal medicines andChinese Pharmacopoeiarecords report that they are used in the treatment of wasting-thirst, which reduces blood glucose levels [11].Puerariapolysaccharides and flavonoids are the main active components; however, small flavonoid molecules are widely studied, while the effects ofPuerariapolysaccharide macromolecules on diabetes have been less investigated. In recent years, polysaccharides in Chinese herbal medicine have attracted much attention because of their biological activities, such as anti-tumor, anti-oxidation, anti-diabetes, and antiviral effects, as well as protection against radiation, lower hyperlipidemia, and immune regulation [12]. Previous studies have shown that certain polysaccharides from traditional Chinese medicine can affect the ecological structure and metabolism of gut microbiota, thus improving the health status of the host [13]. Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides reduce the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes in the gut microbiota of mice fed a high-fat diet, maintain the integrity of the intestinal barrier, and reduce metabolic endotoxemia, thus reducing weight and fat accumulation in mice [14]. Laminaria japonica polysaccharide prevents high-fat-diet-induced insulin resistance in mice through the regulation of gut microbiota [15].Puerariapolysaccharides have recently attracted the attention of researchers. Previous studies found thatPuerariapolysaccharides exert a hypoglycemic effect by activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway [16] through the up-regulation of PI3K and AKT expressions and the down-regulation of the expressions of the FoxO1, PCK2, and G6P enzymes in insulin-resistant cells so as to improve insulin resistance in diabetes patients [17]. They also inhibit α-amylase and α-glucosidase, thus treating T2D [18]. However, in the study of XU C, et al., only GG polysaccharide was used in the treatment of T2D, and its mechanisms of action were mainly inflammatory metabolism, the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and antioxidant activity. Thus, further studies are needed to establish whether FG polysaccharide has the same anti-diabetic effect and which mechanism of action is exerting its effect.Both GG and FG can treat diabetes, but few studies have compared the efficacy and mechanisms of the two. Thus, a comparison of the effects of the two merits further discussion. Therefore, the db/db mouse model of T2D was used in this study, and pharmacodynamic experiments on GG and FG polysaccharides were performed, as well as investigations of their antidiabetic mechanism by using metabolomic and intestinal flora analysis, revealing the relationship between the two. Hence, this study provides the potential mechanism of action of GG and FG polysaccharides in the treatment of T2D."

                "GG and FG have the ability to raise body fluids and quench thirst according to theChinese Pharmacopoeia[11]. The hypoglycemic effect of the flavonoid extracts of these plants has been extensively studied. In addition, previous studies showed that GG polysaccharide treats diabetes [16,17,18], but the therapeutic effect of FG polysaccharide has not been reported. In this study, GG polysaccharides and FG polysaccharides were used for 5 weeks on T2D mice to evaluate their efficacy and explore their potential anti-diabetic mechanisms from the perspectives of metabolomics and intestinal flora.The typical symptoms of T2D are polydipsia, polyuria, hypereating, weight loss, and fatigue [20]. Our results showed a slower weight gain and higher water and food intake in the model group than in the normal group, which is consistent with the above description. Nevertheless, these changes were clearly reversed after the treatment with GG polysaccharide and FG polysaccharide. Moreover, biochemical indicators such as insulin, insulin resistance index, ADP, GLP-1, LEP, FFA, IL-6, and TNF-α in the serum indicated that GG polysaccharide and FG polysaccharide improved insulin resistance and leptin resistance in diabetic mice, as well as chronic inflammation. Previous studies showed that the thirst-quenching effect of GG is associated with improved insulin resistance [21]. Our pharmacodynamic study also proved that both the GG and FG polysaccharides improved insulin resistance, indicating that both of them have the effect of increasing fluids and quenching thirst. In addition, the liver index and adipose index were subjected to a downward trend after the intervention; the liver tissue slices showed that the vesicular fat droplets in the hepatocytes were reduced, and the pyknosis and apoptosis of cells were improved to varying degrees, indicating that both polysaccharides also had a certain protective effect on the liver. The effect of GG polysaccharide in increasing fluid and quenching thirst was better than that of FG polysaccharide at the same dose according to the biochemical indexes, although no statistically significant difference was observed between the two polysaccharides.Metabolomics techniques can be used to discover metabolites that differ between people with diabetes and healthy people, as well as the changes in metabolites after drug intervention, which is of great help in the analysis of diabetes pathogenesis and the mechanism of action in drugs. For example, a metabolomic study found that 50 biomarkers of metabolic disorders show a trend of regression after treatment with red ginseng extract, indicating that T2D can be ameliorated by improving metabolic disorders [22]. A previous article reported differential endogenous metabolites in the serum and urine samples caused by metabolomics, as well as the antidiabetic and antioxidant effects of ginsenoside reevaluated using KEGG enrichment analysis [23]. In our work, the metabolic profiles of the serum in T2D mice and normal mice were analyzed, and a total of 67 differential metabolites were found, mainly lipids, glycerol phospholipids, fatty acids, and amino acid derivatives. The pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the differential metabolites were involved in unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, α-linolenic acid metabolism, glycerolipid metabolism, retinol metabolism, and steroid biohormone synthesis. This result was consistent with the findings of previous studies on abnormal metabolic pathways in T2D [3,4,5]. The metabolic profile of T2D mice was almost back to that of the normal group after the intervention of GG and FG polysaccharides. The GG and FG polysaccharides significantly regulated some endogenous components, and both significantly regulated the glycerophospholipid metabolic pathway. The PPAR signaling pathway is an important pathway regulating lipid metabolism and is also an upstream signaling pathway for glycerophospholipid metabolism, suggesting that the two polysaccharides might exert therapeutic effects on T2D by regulating the PPAR signaling pathway. Spearman correlation analysis showed that taurouronic acid and uric acid were the key metabolites decreased by the GG and FG polysaccharides in the treatment of T2D mellitus; thus, they could be used as potential biomarkers.16SrRNA high-throughput sequencing was performed on the bacterial V3–V4 region in the mouse cecal content to better understand the hypoglycemic mechanisms of the GG and FG polysaccharides. Alpha diversity and beta diversity analysis showed a significant difference in the intestinal flora between the normal group and the model group. However, the richness and diversity were both improved in the model group after the intervention of GG and FG polysaccharides, and the composition of the intestinal flora was almost back to that of the normal group. No significant difference in any index was observed between the effect of GG polysaccharide and FG polysaccharide. The species composition in each group was analyzed at the phylum level, and the abundance of firmicutes in the intestinal microbiota of the T2D mice was lower than in the normal group, while the abundance of Bacteroides was higher than in the normal group, which was consistent with another study revealing that the abundance of firmicutes in the intestinal microbiota of T2D patients was significantly lower than that of normal controls [8]. The abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes was ameliorated after GG and FG polysaccharide intervention. A difference in 45 bacterial genera was found between the model group and the normal group. GG polysaccharide exerted a significant callback to six species, and FG polysaccharide exerted a significant callback to five species. The pathways involved in the microbiota affected by T2D mellitus were the same as those involved in the metabolites affected by T2D mellitus in serum metabolomics. The significantly increased Romboutsia bacteria content after GG polysaccharide treatment was negatively correlated with tauroursocholic acid, The significantly reduced Klebsiella content after FG polysaccharide treatment was positively correlated with uric acid, Romboutsia [24], and Klebsiella [10], which are qualities associated with T2D. These results indicated that T2D affected the metabolic environment in the body by affecting the gut microbiota, and the GG and FG polysaccharides were able to ameliorate the metabolites in the serum by regulating the gut microbiota. In addition, the abundance of tauroursocholic acid and uric acid related to the PPAR signaling pathway was reversed after the intervention of the GG and FG polysaccharides, suggesting that these two polysaccharides exerted a regulatory effect on the PPAR signaling pathway, which was consistent with the metabolomics results.The results of pharmacodynamics, metabolomics, and intestinal microbiota studies showed that the effects of the GG and FG polysaccharides in the treatment of T2D mellitus were related to the regulation of the PPAR signaling pathway. The mechanism of action in the GG and FG polysaccharides was represented by the increase in the expression of LKB1 protein, P-AMPK protein, P-TSC2 protein, and PPARγ protein and the reduction in p-mTOR protein expression. These results suggested that GG and FG polysaccharides might play a role in promoting fluids and quenching thirst through the regulation of the PPAR signaling pathway.Our results showed no significant difference in the efficacy of GG polysaccharide and FG polysaccharide in the treatment of T2D mellitus. The combination of the results of the metabolomics and intestinal microbiota analysis revealed that they improved fluids and quenched thirst using different mechanisms: GG polysaccharide reduced the concentration of taurocholic acid in the serum by increasing the abundance of Romboutsia bacteria, so as to regulate the PPAR signaling pathway and have a therapeutic effect on insulin resistance; FG polysaccharide reduced the uric acid level in the serum by reducing the abundance of Klebsiella bacteria and then regulated the PPAR signaling pathway to exert a therapeutic effect on insulin resistance. Although the regulatory pathways of the two were different, they exerted the same effect of increasing fluid and quenching thirst by regulating the same (PPAR) signaling pathway."

Data Processing and AnalysisMS data were processed for peak detection, matching and alignment using Progenesis QI software (version 2.4, Waters, Milford, MA, USA). The normalized data were imported into the EZinfo software (version 3.0, Waters, USA) to select metabolites with a VIP score greater than 1 and a P value by ANOVA less than 0.05 as differential metabolites. The data file was saved and the differential metabolites were identified using the database Human Metabolome Database (http://www.hmdb.ca/) (accessed on 11 June 2021). to identify whether they were endogenous components; the mass error was 5 ppm, and the secondary fragments were recorded. PCA, PLS, and OPLS-DA were performed using SIMCA-P software (version 14.1, Umetrics, Sweden). The accuracy of OPLS-DA analysis was verified by PRT analysis. GraphPad Prism (version 8.0, Harvey Motulsky, San Diego, CA, USA) was used to draw the graphs; MeV software (version 4.9.0, TIGR, Walnut Creek, CA, USA) was used for heat mapping. MetaboAnalyst 5.0 (https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/) (accessed on 23 July 2021) online software was used to evaluate the enrichment of the metabolic pathways.2.4. Effects of GG and FG Polysaccharides on Intestinal Microflora of T2D MiceThe entire intestine of the mouse was removed using a sterile scalpel, and the outer surface of the intestine was quickly cleaned in pre-cooled normal saline. The required intestinal segments were cut, and the segments were cut and opened. The content was collected and placed in an enzyme-free cryopreservation tube, stored in an ice box at −80 °C, and defrosted for sample testing. The samples were sent to Shanghai Magi Biomedical Technology Co., LTD. to perform the requested measurements. Data analysis was performed in the United States using biological cloud platforms (https://login.majorbio.com/login) (accessed on 15 August 2021). Alpha diversity analysis was performed using Chao 1, Ace, Shannon, and Simpson indices. ANOSIM analysis was used to analyze the similarity between groups, and LEfSe analysis was used to analyze the genus level differences between the normal group and model group.2.5. Western BlottingLiver samples were homogenized in tissue lysis buffer (RIPA: protease inhibitor: phosphorylated protease inhibitor = 100:1:1) and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and stored at −80 °C for later use. The protein concentration of the sample was measured according to the BCA kit procedure.

                "3.1. Pharmacodynamic Analysis3.1.1. Effects of Pueraria Polysaccharides on Physiological IndexesThe weekly body weight, food intake, water intake, and fasting blood glucose of the mice were examined for the entire 5 weeks of the experiment (Figure 1A–D), and the results showed that GG and FG polysaccharides alleviated the symptoms of “three more and one less” (food intake and water intake, fasting blood glucose, weight loss) in type 2 diabetic mice. Glucose tolerance (Figure 2) showed that GG polysaccharides significantly enhanced the glucose metabolism in the mice, and FG polysaccharides had a tendency to increase the glucose metabolism in the mice. In addition, GG and FG polysaccharides improved insulin sensitivity in the mice (Figure 3). No statistically significant difference was observed between the effects of GG polysaccharides and FG polysaccharides.3.1.2. Biochemical Indexes and Liver Histopathological AnalysisSerum biochemical indices (Table 1) showed that insulin, ADP, and GLP-1 were up-regulated, while LEP, FFA, IL-6, and TNF-α decreased. In addition, a decreasing trend in the insulin resistance index, liver index, and adipose index afterPuerariapolysaccharide administration was observed. No significant difference in the above biochemical indexes between the GG polysaccharide and FG polysaccharide groups was observed. Moreover, the alveolar fat droplets decreased, and nuclear pyknosis and apoptosis improved to varying degrees after the intervention of metformin, GG polysaccharide, and FG polysaccharide, as shown inFigure 4.3.2. Metabolomic Analysis3.2.1. Endogenous Metabolites and Metabolic Pathways Associated with T2D MicePCA (Figure 5A,B) and OPLS-DA(ESI-: R2Y-0.994, Q2-0.971; ESI+: R2Y-0.938, Q2-0.752) (Figure 5C,D) both indicated differences in serum metabolites between the model group and the normal group. Furthermore, the 200 permutations test (Figure 6) showed that the OPLS-DA model had a high explanatory power and predictive ability. EZinfo software was used to identify 67 differential metabolites (Table 2) and the heat map (Figure 7) showed that the normal group and the model group were clearly divided into two categories. The enriched metabolic pathways where the different metabolites were involved are shown inFigure 8. The topological analysis of the metabolic pathways showed that the different metabolic profiles between T2D and normal mice were mainly due to the abnormal metabolism of unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, glycerophospholipid, arachidonic acid, α-linolenic acid, glycerol, retinol, and steroid biohormone.3.2.2. Metabolomics Analysis of Serum after GG and FG Polysaccharide Treatment in T2D MiceThe PCA (Figure 9A,B andFigure 10A,B) and PLS-DA (Figure 9C,D andFigure 10C,D) showed that the GG polysaccharide group and FG polysaccharide group were located between the normal group and the model group. The results showed that the metabolic profile and changes in the metabolites of the model group were closer to those in the normal group after intervention with GG polysaccharides and FG polysaccharides, indicating that they ameliorated T2D, which was consistent with the results of the pharmacodynamic experiment.Figure 11A shows the 10 metabolites with evident recall after the administration of GG polysaccharide; a significant increase in PE-NMe2 (18:0/20:4 (8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)), PGP (18:0/PGF1alpha), PC (20:2(11Z,14Z)/TXB2), N-oleoyl phenylalanine, and PS (18:1(11Z)/6 keto-PGF1alpha) was observed, as well as a reduction in tauroursocholic acid, 13-HODE, lysoPC (20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)/0:0), alpha-linolenic acid, and PA (16:0/18:1(11Z)). These metabolites were involved in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, glycerol phospholipid metabolism, and α-linolenic acid metabolism.Figure 11B shows the four metabolites with evident recall after the administration of FG polysaccharide; a significant increase in PC (PGF2alpha/2:0), lysoPE (20:1(11Z)/0:0), and lysoPC (16:1(9Z)/0:0) was observed, as well as a reduction in uric acid. The main pathway involved in these metabolites was glycerophospholipid metabolism.3.2.3. Correlation of Differential Metabolites and Biochemical IndicesThe Spearman correlation analysis was carried out on the differential serum metabolites and biochemical indicators. The results shown inFigure 12A,B, showed that the absolute value of the correlation coefficient between the tauroursocholic acid and all the biochemical indexes was the largest in the GG polysaccharide group, while the absolute value of the correlation coefficient between the uric acid and all the biochemical indexes was the largest in the FG polysaccharide group, indicating that GG polysaccharides significantly decreased the level of tauroursocholic acid in the treatment of T2D. FG polysaccharide significantly decreased the uric acid level in the treatment of T2D.3.3. Gut Microbiota Analysis3.3.1. Effects of Pueraria Polysaccharide on the Species Composition of Gut MicrobiotaAccording to the Chao 1, Ace, Shannon, and Simpson index analyses (Table 3), the cecal microflora was richer and more diverse afterPuerariapolysaccharide intervention. The coverage index of each group was above 0.99, indicating that the sequencing results represented the real situation of the microorganisms in the sample. There was no significant difference in the above parameters between the GG polysaccharide and FG polysaccharide groups.The analysis of the phylum (Figure 13A) revealed a higher relative abundance of Bacteroidetes, as well as lower levels of Firmicutes, desulphurobacteria, Campylobacter, Deferrobacteriaceae, and actinobacteria in the model group than in the normal group.Puerariapolysaccharide treatment reversed the relative abundance of these bacteria modified by T2D, almost reaching the same situation in the normal mice, as shown inFigure 13B. No significant difference between the effects of the GG polysaccharides and FG polysaccharides was observed.The analysis of the genus shown inFigure 14A with the PCoA analysis of all samples based on the weighted-unifrac distance algorithm revealed a clear separation and evident spatial clustering of the plots. The boxplots inFigure 14B represent the distribution of different groups of samples on the PC1 axis, revealing that the difference between the normal group and model group was the largest, and the distance between the GG polysaccharide group and model group was larger than the distance between the FG polysaccharide group and model group. The ANOSIM analysis demonstrated significant differences among the samples, but no significant difference was observed between the GG and FG polysaccharide groups. LEfSe analysis was used with an LDA threshold of two to analyze the differences in the genus levels between the normal group and the model group, and the multi-group comparison strategy was one-against-all. A significant difference in bacterial abundance at the level of 45 genera in the model group was observed, as shown inFigure 15A. The bacterial abundance of 18 genera was significantly affected (p< 0.05) after 5 weeks of FG polysaccharide intervention, and the bacterial abundance of 14 genera was significantly affected (p< 0.05) after 5 weeks of GG polysaccharide intervention, as shown inFigure 15B,C. A total of 20 bacteria had a callback trend at the genus level after the intervention of FG polysaccharide (Figure 16A), and among them, g_Helicobacter, g_norank_f_Ruminococcaceae, and g_Colidextribacter were significantly up-regulated, while the g_Eubacterium_siraeum_group and g_Klebsiella significantly decreased. A total of 23 bacteria had a callback trend at the genus level (Figure 16B), and among them, g_Helicobacter, g_Romboutsia, and g_UBA1819 were significantly up-regulated, while g_Parasutterella, g_Faecalibaculum, and g_Weissella significantly decreased. GG polysaccharides and FG polysaccharides significantly regulated the content of different bacteria except for g_Helicobacter.3.3.2. KEGG Enrichment AnalysisThree levels of information and abundance tables of metabolic pathways were obtained via PICRUSt function prediction. In pathway level 1, the expression of metabolism, organic systems, genetic information processing, environmental information processing, cellular processes, and human disease pathways in the model group was lower than that of the normal group. A callback trend was observed after the intervention withPuerariapolysaccharide (Figure 17). A total of 46 metabolic pathway subfunctions were enriched at pathway level 2; these metabolism-related pathways consisted of carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, and other metabolic pathways. The prediction analysis of pathway level 3 showed the involvement of 338 metabolic pathways in total, and among them, 153 metabolic pathways were significantly different between the normal group and the model group (p< 0.05). The analysis of these 153 metabolic pathways with significant differences revealed that they were related to diabetes, as shown inFigure 18. AfterPuerariapolysaccharide intervention reversed the abundance of these metabolic pathways. There was no significant difference between the effect of GG polysaccharide and FG polysaccharide.3.4. Correlation of Differential Metabolites and Gut MicrobiotaSpearman correlation analysis was carried out on the bacterial taxa and differential serum metabolites relevant toPuerariapolysaccharide to explore the potential functional relationship between gut microbiota and differential metabolites. Six bacteria had a significant relationship with at least three metabolites (p< 0.05) after GG polysaccharide intervention; Romboutsia bacteria played a key role in reducing the level of tauroursocholic acid after GG polysaccharide treatment, as shown inFigure 19A. Five bacteria had a significant relationship with at least one metabolite (p< 0.05) after the intervention of FG polysaccharide; Klebsiella bacteria played a key role in reducing the level of uric acid after FG polysaccharide treatment, as shown inFigure 19B.3.5. Effects of Pueraria Polysaccharide on the PPAR Signaling Pathway in T2D MiceThe protein expression of LKB1, P-AMPK, P-TSC2, and PPARγ in the liver protein of the model group decreased, and the expression of p-mTOR protein increased compared with the normal group. The protein expression of LKB1, P-AMPK, P-TSC2, and PPARγ in the liver protein of the model group increased, and the protein expression of P-mTOR decreased afterPuerariapolysaccharide intervention compared with the normal group. No significant difference in protein expression was observed between the effect of the GG and FG polysaccharides (Figure 20)."

                "This study evaluated the effect of GG and FG polysaccharides in increasing body fluids and quenching thirst to alleviate the symptoms of “three more and one less” in T2D mice. The results of the metabolomics and intestinal flora showed that the GG and FG polysaccharides had different effects on the regulation of serum metabolites and bacteria, but both significantly regulated the glycerophospholipid metabolic pathway. The PPAR signaling pathway was also regulated by the GG and FG polysaccharides.

            "Introduction": [
                "Skin flaps are a widely-used major strategy of plastic, aesthetic, and reconstructive surgeries for treatment of skin defects. This method is used to overcome traumatic skin damages, refractory wounds, cancer excisions, burn injuries, and lower limb vascular ulcers due to its convenience and resilience [1,2,3,4]. Nevertheless, rate of flap tissue loss, as the main challenging issue, varies from 25 to 50% of flap length [5]. Skin flap survival (SFS) is threatened by a triad including mal-perfusion, inflammatory mechanisms, and oxidative stress (Fig.1) [6,7]. Mal-perfusion triggers extensive damage of cell membrane in ischemic flap tissues which results in increased levels of arachidonic acid metabolites. It promotes recruitment of inflammatory cells, substantially the neutrophils. Immune cells produce more reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory mediators in ischemic tissue. ROS threatens tissue viability, causing DNA and cell membrane destruction, lipid peroxidation, cell apoptosis, and protein changes. In addition, ischemia–reperfusion injury (IRI) occurs due to consequent neovascularization. Blood reperfusion triggers a burst of ROS is the cardinal culprit of IRI pathogenesis which is accompanied by impaired cellular redox homeostasis and extensive cellular apoptosis. ROS accumulation and apoptosis of functional cells are major factors resulting from necrosis of skin flaps [8,9,10].Fig. 1Skin flaps are used as a major technique in reconstructive surgery but the survival of flaps decreases under the influence of threatening factors. Saffron increases the survival of skin flaps and has the potential for clinical useFull size imageSystemic or local administration of various therapeutic agents with the aim of preventing distal flap necrosis, has recently attracted growing attention. Treatments include angiogenesis promotion, oxidative stress/apoptosis/inflammation attenuation, administration of agents such as blood viscosity diminishers, calcium channel blockers (CCB), vasodilators, anti-thrombotics, anti-coagulants, anti-inflammatories, anti-oxidants, steroids and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. However, Surgical delay could be used to control distal necrosis but it requires at least one additional surgery [11,12,13,14].Nowadays, there is a special focus on reducing oxidative stress and increasing tissue defense mechanisms to deal with ROS injury. Major antioxidants like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione (GSH) are important for cellular protection due to their ability to detoxify free radicals, such as ROS. At the same importance of ROS elimination, apoptosis control is noticeably mentioned enhance SFS. It would be a challenging issue that except decrease in ROS effects, necrosis, and inflammation, we could increase anti-apoptotics and decrease pro-apoptotics. Bcl-2 is an important protein of BCL2 family that prevent cell death through apoptosis. This family also contains pro-apoptotics such as Bax. By decreasing Bax, or increasing Bcl-2, SFS could be promoted (Fig.2) [15,16].Fig. 2Apoptosis promotes by increasing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. mTOR (especially mTORC1) inhibits autophagy. During autophagy, dysfunctional parts degrades and this results in apoptosis alleviationFull size imageAutophagy as intracellular degradation/recycling of dysfunctional proteins and organelles, has a great control on cell signaling, homeostasis, cell survival, and apoptosis prevention. It can alleviate ROS production and suppress apoptosis via the mTOR signaling pathway. It is reported that autophagy has attenuated liver IRI, inhibited apoptosis induced by intestinal ischemia-reperfusion, and had important role in disc degeneration due to alleviating mitochondrial dysfunction. As a consequence, research suggest that autophagy induction could enhance angiogenesis, decrease apoptosis and oxidative stress. Altogether it might be beneficial for skin flaps survival (Fig.2) [17,18].Dried stigmas ofCrocus sativusL. (Saffron), a worthy plant of Iridaceae family is mainly made up of carbohydrates including starch, reducing sugars, gums, pectin, pentosans, and dextrins. It is a plant with a vast range of pharmacological properties such as anti-carcinogenic, anti-mutagenic, and anti-genotoxic [19,20], anti-oxidant [21], memory enhancer [22], neuro-protective [23,24], anti-depressant, exhilarator, antiasthma, and cardio-protective effects (Fig.1) [25]. Even it is declared that Saffron is a potential drug-supplement for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (COVID) management [26,27]. Components such as Crocin (digentiobiosyl8, 8′-diapocarotene-8, 8′-oate; C44H64O24) [28] and Crocetin are more responsible for cardio-protective and anti-atherosclerotic properties [29,30]. Saffron has been used as an effective factor on neuro-degenerative disease and related memory impairment, ischemic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration, coronary artery disease, blood pressure abnormalities, acute and chronic inflammatory disease, mild to moderate depression, seizure, Parkinsonism [31,32]. It is reported that oral administration of Saffron extract, has inhibited cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, mitomycin-C and urethane induced genotoxicity in male Swiss albino mice [33,34].Skin flap survival is a process that depends heavily on micro-environment of the tissue. Considering this issue and the properties of Saffron, it seems to be possible to manage oxidative stress and cell death of skin flap by Saffron administration. Saffron have received growing attention as potential preventive agent that scavenges ROS and detoxify them, inhibit inflammatory pathways, and finally decrease cell death. The present study was designed to investigate the modifying effects of Saffron extract on survival, antioxidant status, inflammation, apoptotic markers, histopathologic changes, and its probable effect on mTOR pathway of skin flap model in Sprauge-Dawley albino rats."

                "Despite all scientific advances and the use of methods that increase skin flap survival, the maintenance of flap tissue against necrosis and tissue damage is still a major concern for surgeons and researchers [1,38]. So, for the first time in the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of Saffron (Crocus sativusL.) on Skin flap survival and investigate whether it affects via mTOR pathway. Our studies were performed at three levels: macroscopic, microscopic and molecular. Our results indicated that the use of Saffron extract significantly reduced tissue necrosis rate. We observed that MDA (as a marker of lipid peroxidation), MPO (as a marker of neutrophil infiltration), and Bax (pro-apoptotic) significantly decreased in Saffron treated groups. In the other hand, SOD (anti-ROS enzyme), Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic), neovascularization, epithelialization, epithelialization thickness, and fibroblast migration increased consequent to Saffron administration. Saffron had also no effect on mTOR or p-mTOR expression.Nowadays, increasing of skin flap survival is the challenging issue of research. The survival of skin flaps is threatened by mal-perfusion, mal-oxygenation, low excretion and retention of tissue waste, necrosis and apoptosis, ischemia-induced injury, reperfusion injury, ROS injury, and inflammatory processes. It seems much more useful to avoid the creation of flap threatening processes and factors, rather than confronting them such as prevention of tissue necrosis via reduction of ROS production, elimination of created ROS, increasing of total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of flap tissue, and even use of exogenous antioxidants [10,15,36,39,40].Studies have demonstrated the protective effect of Saffron on oxidative stress in different tissues such as abdominal organs, kidney, testis, and endothelial cells [21,41,42,43,44,45,46]. Crocin, safranal, carotene and crocetin as the most abundant constituents of Saffron stigmas, represent antioxidant effects. Noticeably, Saffron extract is mentioned as a potent anti-oxidant with high ability to scavenge ROS, especially superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) resulting in inhibitory effect on lipid peroxidation [22,29,32,41]. Also, Saffron is suggested in autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and cerebral ischemia [23,47,48]. In these ischemic models, Saffron or its active components, reduced MDA level and lipid peroxidation, increased the activity of SOD, GPx, and antioxidant capacity.In our study, flap necrosis and MDA levels increased with skin flap surgery. MDA, as a stable metabolite of lipid peroxidation, indicates the amount of oxidative stress. Our results also showed that flap necrosis and the level of MDA in skin flap tissue was significantly reduced by administering Saffron. This directly confirms the antioxidant effect of Saffron on the skin flap tissue. By reducing oxidative stress, peroxidation and degradation of lipids are also reduced and less MDA is produced. By a decrease in lipid degradation, it can be expected that cell membranes remain undamaged which potentially prevents arachidonic acid-dependent inflammation. Considering that we have administrated Saffron orally, it is possible to have a good assurance of the absorption and bioavailability of Saffron, because its effects have appeared in the skin tissue. Oral administration has numerous benefits, such as easily applicability, availability, and being more physiologic. All of these results are consistent with pervious findings which mentioned above [5,49]. Another study [30] has evaluated Saffron effect on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, in mediation of endothelial cell-survival against oxidative stress. The results of this study showed that Saffron administration has improved viability of cells in response to H2O2-induced toxicity and has reduced production of ROS in H2O2-treated cells. It is a confirmation to our results.Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is an enzyme that scavenges superoxide radicals and prevents their destructive effects. In our study, skin flap surgery significantly reduced SOD activity in the flap tissue. This means that flap surgery reduces ability of tissue to cope with oxidative stress. In the groups that treated with Saffron, the SOD activity increased significantly. Therefore, it can be concluded that Saffron has increased tissue ability to deal with reactive oxygen species. In recent research [50] about crocin effect on the viability of random pattern skin flaps, the authors have reported SOD increases after crocin application. This research and aforementioned ones [6,11,18,28,38,42] is in line with our results and have reported that SOD increasing would result in tissue protection against ROS damage [16,51].Recent articles have also focused on anti-inflammatory properties of Saffron [52] and even declared that Saffron represents a promising substance for toning down cytokine storm during COVID-19, as well as a potential preventive treatment for COVID-19 [26]. Scholars also mentioned that crocin anti-inflammatory properties results from effecting on cyclooxygenase pathway and inhibition of both cyclooxygenase1 (COX1), and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) enzymes, and inhibition of prostaglandin E2 (PGE -2) production, in a dose dependent manner [53]. Crocin has presented an inhibitory role on the high levels of bone joint exo-glycosidases, cathepsin-D and tartarate resistant acid phosphatases. Saffron and crocin are used to show relieving effects on arthritis by modifying cartilage deteriorating enzymes, inflammatory mediators, and matrix metalloproteinases MMPs [28]. The Myeloperoxidase (MPO) enzyme is active in tissue-infiltrated neutrophils, producing oxygen-reactive species so that neutrophils can fight their targets with these ROS. Therefore, the activity of MPO enzyme is a manifestation of inflammation and chemotaxis of neutrophils. In addition to other effects of inflammation, these ROS also cause damage to the skin flap tissue [1,36,49]. In our study, skin flap surgery increased MPO activity, but in the groups that received Saffron, the enzyme activity level decreased significantly and resulted in an increase of skin flap survival. However, this effect did not change much with increasing the dose of Saffron in our experiment, and in both groups of Saffron 40 and Saffron 80, the rate of MPO activity decrease, was the same. Other studies [1,49,54] confirm our results about increasing the survival of skin flaps following a decrease in MPO activity.In addition to tissue necrosis, apoptosis is mentioned as a noticeable process in tissue loss. Numerous mediators could co/regulate apoptosis pathways. It would be a challenging issue that except decrease in ROS, necrosis, and tissue inflammation, we could increase anti-apoptotics and decrease pro-apoptotics, which would directly result in enhancement of skin flap survival [16,55]. Our study showed skin flap surgery results in increasing of Bax (pro-apoptotic) and decreasing of Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic), meaning apoptosis promotion and consequent skin flap tissue loss. Saffron administration reversed this issue and resulted in decreasing of flap tissue loss and also expression of Bax, and increasing of tissue viability and Bcl-2. So, it might have concluded that Saffron moderates tissue loss via effecting on the expression intracellular apoptosis regulators. Also, a study [30] demonstrated that apoptosis has reduced significantly by Saffron administration in endothelial cells, which is similar to our results. Other studies on skin flap survival have confirmed that skin flap viability enhances with Bcl-2 increasing and Bax decreasing [16,56,57].New research in recent years have suggested the role of autophagy in apoptosis, and declared that autophagy could decrease apoptosis, oxidative damage, and skin flap tissue loss. Moreover, the mTOR signaling pathway has been shown to act as an inhibitor of autophagy. We aimed to study the possible involvement of the mTOR pathway in the protective effects of Saffron. Studies have been performed on the effect of Crocin in liver cancer [58] and Crocetin in breast cancer [59] and their effects on autophagy have been reported, but the results of our study showed that Saffron has no effect on mTOR or p-mTOR expression in skin flap tissue. We did not observe significant mTOR and p-mTOR changes between groups. This indicates that Saffron effect on flap survival might be independent of mTOR and p-mTOR expression.Histologically, neovascularization causes better perfusion and blood supply, so it prevents necrosis. Fibroblast migration helps tissue repair and epithelialization is as an indicator of healing process. In our study, Saffron treatment increased all of these items. Our results are consistent with previous studies [1,6,18,50,60,61,62].Finally, it seems that Saffron has protective effect on skin tissue and could prevent skin flap tissue loss. Our study was an experimental study and all limitations of experimental studies apply to ours. More research is needed to determine all the positive effects or toxicities of Saffron. To determine the greater extent of the impact of Saffron on the survival of the skin flap, it is suggested that researchers who will work on this issue in the future consider (1) measurement of skin flap survival while using mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin to determine the contribution of this pathway to the rate of tissue loss, and (2) immunohistochemistry (IHC) examination of flap tissue for vascular growth factors (3) investigation of other molecular markers that are related to autophagy (4) measure markers at RNA level and protein level (by western blotting and IHC)."
