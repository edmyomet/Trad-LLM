                "terminalia arjuna, commonly known as arjuna, belongs to the family of combretaceae. its bark decoction is being used in the indian subcontinent for anginal pain, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and dyslipidemia, based on the observations of ancient physicians for centuries. the utility of arjuna in various cardiovascular diseases needs to be studied further. therefore, the present review is an effort to give a detailed survey of the literature summarizing the experimental and clinical studies pertinent to arjuna in cardiovascular disorders, which were particularly performed during the last decade. systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and clinical studies of arjuna were retrieved through the use of pubmed, google scholar, and cochrane databases. most of the studies, both experimental and clinical, have suggested that the crude drug possesses anti-ischemic, antioxidant, hypolipidemic, and antiatherogenic activities. its useful phytoconstituents are: triterpenoids, β-sitosterol, flavonoids, and glycosides. triterpenoids and flavonoids are considered to be responsible for its beneficial antioxidant cardiovascular properties. the drug has shown promising effect on ischemic cardiomyopathy. so far, no serious side effects have been reported with arjuna therapy. however, its long-term safety still remains to be elucidated. though it has been found quite useful in angina pectoris, mild hypertension, and dyslipidemia, its exact role in primary/secondary coronary prevention is yet to be explored.keywords:antioxidant; cardiovascular disorders; coronary prevention; flavonoids; terminalia arjuna; triterpenoids."

                "coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is a viral disease that infects the lower airways, causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and fatal pneumonia. the ripple effect of the covid-19 outbreak has created serious problems in the healthcare systems of many countries and had far-reaching consequences for the global economy. thus, effective control measures should be implemented for this coronavirus infection in the future. the ongoing episode of the sars-cov-2 sickness, covid-19, in china, and the subsequent irregular spread of contamination to different nations, has alarmed the clinical and academic community primarily due to the deadly nature of this disease. being a newly identified virus in the viral classification and having the highest mutation rate, rapid therapeutics are not readily available for treating this ailment, leading to the widespread of the disease and causing social issues for affected individuals. evidence of ayurveda and traditional chinese medicine (tcm) has been found in ancient civilizations, such as those of the hindus, babylonians, hebrews, and arabs. although tcm and ayurvedic herbs do not promise to be very effective treatments for this pandemic, they can reduce infectivity and virulence by enhancing immunity and showing effectiveness in rehabilitation after covid-19 disease. thus, they could be used as sources of inhibitor molecules for certain phenomena, such as viral replication, attachment to the host, 3cl protease inhibition, 3a ion channel inhibitors, and reverse transcription inhibition. medicinal plants from tcm and ayurveda and their biologically active phytoconstituents can effectively modulate the targets and pathways relevant to inflammation and immune responses in human bodies. the present review analyzes the role of certain tcm and ayurvedic medicinal plants in healing covid-19 infection. medicinal plants such asglycyrrhiza glabra(licorice),curcuma longa(turmeric), andzingiber officinale(ginger) are regarded as the main antiviral herbs. their extracts and individual bioactive compounds could be used as potential substances for developing remedies to prevent or cure the coronavirus disease. generally, antiviral phytochemicals obtained from natural sources are considered potent candidates for fighting covid-19 infection and rehabilitation after it.keywords:ayurveda; covid-19; tcm; curcumin; gingerol.; glycyrrhizin; immunomodulation; medicinal plants; quercetin; virucidal effect."

                "with growing antipathy toward conventional prescription drugs due to the fear of adverse events, the general and patient populations have been increasingly using complementary and alternative medications (cams) for managing acute and chronic diseases. the general misconception is that natural herbal-based preparations are devoid of toxicity, and hence short- and long-term use remain justified among people as well as the cam practitioners who prescribe these medicines. in this regard, ayurvedic herbal medications have become one of the most utilized in the east, specifically the indian sub-continent, with increasing use in the west. recent well-performed observational studies have confirmed the hepatotoxic potential of ayurvedic drugs. toxicity stems from direct effects or from indirect effects through herbal metabolites, unknown herb-herb and herb-drug interactions, adulteration of ayurvedic drugs with other prescription medicines, and contamination due to poor manufacturing practices. in this exhaustive review, we present details on their hepatotoxic potential, discuss the mechanisms, clinical presentation, liver histology and patient outcomes of certain commonly used ayurvedic herbs which will serve as a knowledge bank for physicians caring for liver disease patients, to support early identification and treatment of those who present with cam-induced liver injury.keywords:ayush system; ayurveda; chronic liver disease; complementary and alternative medicines; drug induced liver injury; herb induced liver injury."

                "pomegranate (punica granatum) is a tree of the punicaceae family that is widespread all over the world and has several types and therapeutic uses. the current study aimed to investigate the phytochemical compounds by gc analysis and carried out physical characterization of the pomegranate seed oil and its self-nanoemulsifying system. then antioxidant, anti-diabetic, and anti-lipase activities were investigated for both.the pomegranate seed oil was extracted, and its self-nanoemulsifying system was then prepared. phytochemical compounds were analyzed by gc, and physical characterization was established of the pomegranate seed oil and its self-nanoemulsifying system. then antioxidant, anti-diabetic, and anti-lipase activities were investigated for both.the gc-ms analysis revealed that punicic acid, β-eleosteric acid, catalpic acid, α-eleosteric acid, and oleic acid were the most predominant compounds in pomegranate seed oil. other active compounds like linoleic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, and α-linolenic acid were detected in trace percentages. the self-nanoemulsifying system was prepared using various concentrations of surfactant (tween 80), co-surfactant (span 80), and pomegranate seed oil. the selected formulation had a pdi of 0.229 ± 0.09 and a droplet size of 189.44 ± 2.1 nm. the free radical scavenging activity of pomegranate seed oil, the self-emulsifying system, and trolox was conducted using dpph. the oil-self-nanoemulsifying system showed potent antioxidant activity compared to trolox. also, pomegranate oil inhibited α-amylase with a weak ic50value of 354.81 ± 2.3 µg/ml. the oil self-nanoemulsifying system showed potent activity compared to acarbose and had a weaker ic50value (616.59 ± 2.1 µg/ml) and a potent ic50value (43.65 ± 1.9 µg/ml) compared to orlistat.pomegranate seed oil self-nanoemulsifying system could be applied in the future for the preparation of possible oral medications for the prevention and treatment of oxidative stress, diabetes, and obesity due to its high activity against free radical, amylase, and lipase enzymes compared to pomegranate seed oil itself and the references used. this study reveals that self-nanoemulsion systems can enhance oil drug formulations by improving pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, acting as drug reservoirs, and facilitating efficient oil release.keywords:punica granatum; anti-diabetic; anti-obesity; antioxidant; nanoemulsion; self-nanoemulsifying system."

                "tobacco (nicotiana tobacum) and tobacco products are the most critical public health challenges today across the globe. nicotine is the main chemical composition of tobacco and is associated with withdrawal syndrome. a laboratory animal is commonly employed as a model to investigate nicotine toxicity, drug dependence, reinforcing effects, and the protective effects of samples against nicotine-induced toxicity. the first in-vitro model was developed to prove the protective effect of babbul (acacianilotica linn.) against nicotine poisoning caused by consumption of tobacco products. the hptlc method for estimating the protective effect against nicotine poisoning was performed by taking the solvent systems dichloromethane, methanol, and liquid ammonia (25 %)(9:1:0.04v/v/v). this in-vitro approach was done by treating the bark of the acacia nilotica extract with a standard solution of nicotine, which reduced the concentration of nicotine by 39.12 %. the prescribed hptlc method can be used successfully to assess acacia nilotica's protective impact against nicotine toxicity caused by intake of nicotine containing tobacco products.keywords:acacia nilotica; hptlc; herbal medicine; nicotine; tobacco."

                "background:diabetes is a metabolic disorder requiring the administration of insulin or other oral hypoglycemic medicines. although metformin is a popular prescription for type 2 diabetes, long-term use of chemotherapy-based diabetes medications can be hazardous. as a result, novel plant medicines with a high concentration of bioactive molecules, no harmful side effects, and potent pharmacological effects must be found. edible boswellia sacra (b. sacra) flueck oleo-gum resin is widely utilized to treat many clinical diseases in traditional arab, chinese, african, and ayurvedic medicine.objective:the goal of this study was to examine the possible therapeutic benefits of several b. sacra oleo-gum resin extracts on rat streptozotocin (stz)-induced hyperglycemia (type ii).materials and methods:for 29 days, hyperglycemic rats are given either metformin (the reference drug; 250 mg/kg body weight per day) or several b. sacra extracts (ethanol, methanol, hydrodistilled, ethyl acetate, and acetone extracts) at doses of 200 or 400 mg/kg/day. blood glucose levels and body weights were measured before the initiation and at 7, 11, 16, 22, and 29 days after oral treatment. furthermore, an oral glucose tolerance test (ogtt) was carried out. at the end of the study, the rats were euthanized, and blood samples were obtained to evaluate cytokines (interleukin (il-)2 and il-8), reduced glutathione (gsh), superoxide dismutase (sod), and serum insulin levels. the pancreas and liver tissues were rapidly excised, washed, fixed, and kept in a 10% formalin buffer for histological examination.results:b. sacra's ethanolic extract had the greatest concentration of total pentacyclic triterpenic acid (pta) (391.52 mg/g) in comparison to the other extracts. the lower dose of b. sacra ethanol extract, 200 mg/kg/day, reduces blood glucose levels more efficiently than the higher dose of 400 mg/kg/day. in a 180-min ogtt, diabetic rats given ethanol extract (200 mg/kg) performed no better than control rats and even outperformed those given the reference medication metformin. additionally, ethanol extract (200 mg/kg)- or metformin-treated diabetic rats gained weight. this was associated with a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in serum levels of il-2 and il-8, a reduction in oxidative stress as evidenced by a significant (p < 0.05) increase in sod and gsh compared to the untreated diabetic group, and a significant (p < 0.05) increase in serum insulin levels compared to normal plasma rat levels. these discoveries, which were eventually confirmed by histochemical assays, indicated that the ethanol extract of b. sacra greatly enhanced the cellular architecture of pancreatic and liver cells.conclusion:the present investigation indicates that the ethanol extract of b. sacra oleo-gum resin, which contains a high proportion of acetyl-β-boswellic acid (β-aba) and acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (akba), possesses antihyperglycemic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant properties for the first time to our knowledge. additionally, it restores hepatic cells in stz-induced diabetic rats and protects the pancreas against oxidative damage. thus, the current study's results give a scientific rationale for the use of b. sacra in the medical management of diabetes and associated complications. more investigation into the metabolic profiles of these extracts must be conducted to establish the precise mechanism of action of the ethanol extract.keywords:antioxidants; boswellia sacra gum resin; diabetes; hypoglycemic agents."

                "background:in recent years, antibiotic resistance has emerged as a global health concern in bacterial infections such as urinary tract infections (utis). uropathogenic escherichia coli is the most frequent organism responsible for both simple and complex utis. staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa are frequently associated with complicated utis. sri lanka has significant resources of medicinal plants used to cure utis in ayurvedic and traditional medicine.methods:agar well diffusion and broth microdilution methods were used to determine the antibacterial activity of the methanolic extract of ten medicinal plants against p. aeruginosa atcc27853, s.aureus atcc25923, e.coli atcc25922 and their uti positive strains extracted from positive culture plates. as a preliminary toxicity assay, the brine shrimp lethality assay (bsla) was used to determine its cytotoxicity.results:the methanolic fruits extract of p. emblica demonstrated the highest antibacterial activity against both e. coli atcc25922 and e. coli uti-positive strains. b. diffusa roots extract exhibited the highest activity against s. aureus atcc25923, while t. chebula fruits extract showed the highest activity against the s. aureus uti-positive strain. t. involucrata roots extract displayed the highest activity against p. aeruginosa atcc27853, and z. officinale rhizomes extract showed the highest activity against the p. aeruginosa uti-positive strain. moreover, the plant mixture showed the most substantial antibacterial effect against p. aeruginosa atcc27853. however, the methanolic seed extract of c. melo did not exhibit any antimicrobial effects against the selected organisms. all plant material, including the plant mixture, showed cytotoxicity according to the bsla.conclusion:all the methanolic extracts including p. emblica fruits, o. tenuiflorum whole plant, t. chebula fruits, z. officinale rhizome, t. terrestris roots, t. involucrata roots, a. lanata whole plant. b. diffusa roots and a. falcatus roots showed antimicrobial effects against selected strains except c. melo seed extract. the results of the present study evidently supports the traditional and ayurvedic use of these plants for the treatment of utis. this paves the way for another praise for new plant-based therapeutic product development for the treatment of utis. however, further toxicity studies are needed for medicinal dose determination.keywords:antimicrobial; bsla; medicinal plant; utis; uropathogenic."

                "objectives:diastolic dysfunction represents an important pathophysiological intermediate between hypertension and heart failure. in the last two decades, the prevalence of heart failure patients having normal or near normal ejection fraction (ef) has increased to around 60 %. it thus poses a great morbidity and mortality risk to the population. in view of present scenario of high prevalence, lack of evidence-based therapy, and limited clinical trials, this study aimed to evaluate how a unani formulation affects the improvement of the left ventricular diastolic function.methods:this clinical trial was set up as a randomized, placebo-controlled study involving 35 participants, with 18 individuals in the test group and 17 in the control group. test group received 3.5 g of a polyherbal unani formulation in capsule form along with 35 ml of an extract ofborago officinalisl. (arq-e-gaozaban), divided into two doses after meals. meanwhile, the control group received a placebo in the same manner over an eight-week period. follow-ups were conducted every 15 days to assess both subjective and objective parameters in all participants.results:the test formulation shows significant improvement in dyspnea and diastolic function from baseline to the end of trial (p<0.05), slight improvement in palpitations (p>0.05) and highly significant improvement in easy fatigability (p=0.001) as compared to the control.conclusions:the present study shows the effectiveness of the test drug in enhancing the diastolic function of left ventricle and alleviating other symptoms associated with ventricular diastolic dysfunction. nevertheless, additional research with longer follow-up durations is necessary to clarify its efficacy and establish optimal treatment approaches for ventricular diastolic dysfunction in unani medicine.keywords:arq-e-gaozaban; zoaf-e-qalb; unani medicine; herbal formulation; left ventricular diastolic dysfunction."

                "introduction:low back and neck pain are common musculoskeletal disorders with multiple treatment options. india's traditional medical systems, known as ayush (ayurveda, yoga and naturopathy, unani, siddha, sowa-rigpa and homoeopathy) offer range of interventions and are widely used. in view of limited documentation of adverse events following ayush interventions for lumbar and cervical spondylosis, we synthesized evidence and estimated proportion of studies reporting adverse events.methods:we systematically searched all published documents from biomedical and multidisciplinary abstract and citation databases and ayush-specific repositories from their inception to april 2021. we selected studies as per inclusion criteria and extracted information, adhering to prisma guidelines. we systematically reviewed the qualitative evidence form the selected studies.results:majority (94%) of the selected 113 studies were interventional studies and included 77 (68.1%) journal articles and 35 (31%) academic dissertations. among the ayush systems, considerable proportion was from ayurveda (32.7%), followed by siddha (24.8%), yoga (22.1%), unani (15.9%) and homoeopathy (4.4%). almost three-fourths of the studies were on lumbar spondylosis (65%; n = 74), followed by cervical spondylosis (31%; n = 35), and the remaining four included both. thirteen percent of the 113 studies described adverse events [yoga = 9.7%; unani = 1.8% and homoeopathy = 1.8%]. more adverse events were reported among the studies on lumbar (9.7%) than cervical spondylosis (2.7%). the nature of interventions were non-pharmacological (10.6%; n = 12), pharmacological (n = 2; 1.8%) or combined (n = 1; 0.9%).conclusions:only one in eight studies reported any adverse event following ayush interventions for cervical and lumbar spondylosis. there could be certain degree of underreporting of adverse events and requires further exploration. prospero registration id crd42020167433.keywords:adverse events; adverse reactions; ayurveda; homoeopathy; musculoskeletal disorders; siddha; unani; yoga and naturopathy."

                "a large number of people annually lose their lives to tuberculosis (tb), which is an age-old disease caused by the mycobacterium tuberculosis. the global spread of tb is a concern for all regions. the south-east asian region recorded 46% of all new tb cases in 2021, followed by the african and western pacific regions with 23% and 18%, respectively. researchers are always searching at natural substances for potential alternative therapeutics to tackle the worrisome growth in multi-drug-resistant (mdr) tuberculosis due to the high costs associated with developing new treatments and unfavourable side effects of currently used synthetic pharmaceuticals. phytochemicals show promising results as a future health aid due to their multi-targeting ability on pathogen cells. in the search for new drug leads, the ayurvedic and siddha medical systems have made an extensive use of ethnomedicinal tools, including the use of plants like amalaki (emblica officinalis gaertn.), guduchi (tinospora cordifolia willd.), sariva (hemidesmus indicus r.br.), kustha (saussurea lappa falc.), turmeric (curcuma longa mal.) and green tea (camellia sinensis linn.). these sources are high in flavonoids, polyphenols, tannins and catechins, has been shown to reduce the risk of tb. in this overview, we look at how natural sources like plants, algae and mushrooms have helped researchers to find new drug leads, and how to back these natural sources through mapping the molecular approaches and other approaches has helped them to defeat mdr.keywords:ayurveda; mycobacterium tuberculosis; nanoparticles; natural resources; tuberculosis."

                "excellent memory, extraordinary intelligence, great academic achievement, and successful career are the dreams of every individual in this era of competition and professionalism. a good memory power acts as a catalyst in all walks of life, be it academic success or maintenance of personal relationships. it is observed that an average man uses only 10% of his natural memory. remaining 90% is left unused in a haphazard manner. as per the american psychologist carl emil seashore, if one is alert and makes systematic attempts to awaken and use the natural memory properly, his/her natural memory would be activated creatively and would offer benefits of higher order. a comparative study was conducted comprising 90 subjects to know the efficacy of medhya rasayana and yogic practices in short-term memory of school-going children. the study was conducted over a period of 3 months. it was an open, prospective, and randomized clinical study. the subjects of group a formed the control group and they were observed silently for 3 months without any intervention. the subjects in group b were administered with choorna (powder) of four medhya rasayanas, mandukaparni (centella asiatica linn.), yashtimadhu (glycyrrhiza glabra linn.), guduchi [tinospora cordifolia (willd.) miers ex hook. f. and thoms.], and sankhapushpi (convolvulus pluricaulis choisy), at a dose of 2 g twice daily with milk. subjects belonging to group c were advocated regular yogic practices of asanas, pranayama, and dhyana. further study revealed that among the three groups, group b treated with medhya rasayana showed highly significant and most effective changes with respect to objective parameters in the tests, i.e. (1) short-term memory test pictures and (2) serial recall effects test using memory scope. among the three groups, group c treated with yogic practices showed highly significant and most effective changes with respect to subjective and objective parameters in mini mental status scale i.e. test 3. the treatment is cost effective and devoid of side effects, which can be beneficial for the community. mean increase after first follow-up in group b was higher as compared to group c. this shows that medhya rasayanas are quick in action and bring about improvement in memory faster when compared with yogic practices. so, on the whole, group b can be considered to be the most efficient among the three groups.keywords:medhya rasayana; yogic practices; school children; short term memory."

                "several methods of limb bandaging have been described to reduce the oedema and enhance ulcer healing in complicated varicose veins, with varying success rates. leech therapy has never before been tried for the same. we evaluated the effectiveness of medicinal leech therapy in producing venous decongestion, reversal of oedema, hyperpigmentation and healing of varicose ulcer(s). whether the leech selectively sucks venous blood was also investigated. hirudo medicinalis (medicinal leech) was applied to the area surrounding the varicose ulcer(s) in 20 patients with varicose veins with complications and the patients monitored for ulcer healing, and decrease in hyperpigmentation, oedema and limb girth. the partial pressure of o2 (po2) of 7 patients' arterial and venous blood was compared to that sucked by the leech. after leech therapy all the ulcers showed healing, while 95 per cent of patients showed a decrease in oedema and limb girth. seventy five per cent patients demonstrated a decrease in hyperpigmentation. the mean po2 of blood sucked by the leech was 40.05 +/- 7.24 mmhg, which was similar to the mean po2 of the patients' venous blood (34.33 +/- 8.4 mmhg). thus it appears from this study that the medicinal leech sucks venous blood and aids ulcer healing, and can probably therefore be used as an effective adjunct in the management of complicated varicose veins. this however requires further evaluation by controlled trials."
